/**
 * ALIGNMENT CHECK — measures where every slide's body blocks actually sit.
 *
 *   node align-check.mjs                      # all slides, from deck.config
 *   node align-check.mjs "http://localhost:5174/?all" 69
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AS A HARNESS
 *
 * `qa.mjs` catches content that leaves the 1280x720 frame and `video-safe.mjs`
 * catches content that enters the instructor-video rectangle. Neither has an
 * opinion about content that is comfortably inside the frame and still wrong:
 * a 468px figure inside a full-width block sits hard left with a 500px hole
 * beside it, and every automated check passes. That is the defect this finds.
 *
 * THE RULE IT ENFORCES (session-3 rule S14)
 *
 * The header is pinned at x=145. A body block must therefore be either
 *
 *   ALIGNED   its left edge on the header's, x=145
 *   CENTRED   its centre on the content area's centre
 *
 * and anything else is DRIFT: it reads as a mistake, because it is one. The
 * usual cause is `mx-auto` on an auto-width block, which distributes nothing.
 *
 * IT ALSO CATCHES TWO THINGS `qa.mjs` STRUCTURALLY CANNOT
 *
 * A 14-agent review of this deck found nine slides with defects that every
 * existing harness passed, in exactly two shapes, so both are now measured here:
 *
 *   CHROME    text sitting under the deck's own controls. The slide counter, the
 *             nav arrows and the footer mark are drawn OVER the stage, so a
 *             callout whose last line reaches y=660 is inside the frame,
 *             inside the video-safe area, and unreadable. Three slides shipped
 *             like that and read as "the a__r_ss becomes".
 *
 *   CLIPPED   a panel whose content is larger than its own clip box. A
 *             `CodeBlock` with `maxHeight` shorter than its file scrolls, and a
 *             `Terminal` narrower than its longest line shears it. Both look
 *             like a finished panel: there is no scrollbar at this size, just a
 *             line cut through the middle of a glyph. On one slide the clipped
 *             line was the one the slide's own bullet pointed at.
 *
 *             Detected by COMPUTED STYLE, not by class name. The first version
 *             matched `pre, .overflow-auto, .overflow-hidden` and still missed a
 *             7px overflow on slide 15 and a 13px HORIZONTAL one on slide 41,
 *             which is how a hand-written selector fails: it describes the markup
 *             you remember rather than the boxes that actually scroll.
 *
 *   WRAPPED   a label that broke across lines when it is one token to the reader.
 *             `python manage.py runserver` inside a sentence rendered as
 *             "python manage.py" then "runserver", and a squeezed `FileTree` note
 *             listing four filenames wrapped to FOUR lines on the row the slide
 *             was comparing. Monospace leaves and `·`-joined notes are checked,
 *             because those are the two that carry meaning as a single unit.
 *
 * It also reports the empty band under the last body block, because a slide with
 * 200px of dead space at the bottom and a cramped figure is a layout that needs
 * splitting, not nudging.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IGNORES
 *
 * A harness that cries wolf does not get run. The first pass reported 18 of 69
 * slides and only two were defects, so these four categories are excluded by
 * name, each for a stated reason:
 *
 *   1. `pointer-events-none` decoration. The background blobs bleed off canvas
 *      BY DESIGN, and `qa.mjs` already excludes them for the same reason.
 *   2. SVG children. Their `className` is an SVGAnimatedString, not a string, and
 *      an SVG's internal geometry is not slide layout.
 *   3. `place-items-end` slots. That is the mascot corner on RecapSlide,
 *      KeyTakeawaysSlide, PracticeSlide and FeedbackSlide: right-aligned on
 *      purpose, so measuring it against the left datum is meaningless.
 *
 *      Excluded from the DRIFT verdict only, NOT from the tail measurement. The
 *      first version excluded them from both and then reported 332px of dead
 *      space under the recap slide, which is where its mascot is. Skipping a
 *      block for alignment purposes does not mean the pixels are empty.
 *   4. CENTRED slide types entirely. On a divider, the Welcome frame and the
 *      Thank You frame the title is itself centred, so "the header's left edge"
 *      is not a datum any body block should match, and a tall centred layout's
 *      bottom band is not dead space. Detected, not hardcoded: if the title's
 *      own centre is on the stage centre, the slide is centred.
