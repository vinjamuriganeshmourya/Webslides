/**
 * ONE CONTRACT FOR EVERY FLOW-CHART VARIANT.
 *
 * Same principle as `flowFigure.ts` next door: it describes **meaning** and
 * never geometry, because turning meaning into geometry is the only thing the
 * variants disagree about. Picking a winner is renaming one component at the
 * call site.
 *
 * WHAT THE KIT'S `FlowChart` CANNOT DO, WHICH IS WHY THIS LAB EXISTS
 *
 * `slide-kit/slide-template/src/ui/flow.tsx` lays its nodes out with a single
 * flex row or column. That is not a limitation of its styling, it is the whole
 * data model: there is one list of nodes and each is drawn after the last.
 *
 *   1. **It cannot branch.** The registry calls `FlowChartSlide` "a process with
 *      branches" and the component cannot draw one. It takes `nodes`, not edges,
 *      so there is nowhere to say that this node leads to two others.
 *   2. **It cannot label an exit.** Established flow-chart practice is that every
 *      arrow leaving a decision carries its condition (Yes/No, Pass/Fail). With
 *      no edges there is nothing to hang the label on.
 *   3. **It cannot loop back.** A rework path returning to an earlier step is the
 *      single most common shape in a real process, and a flex row runs one way.
 *   4. **`shape: 'diamond'` is a costume.** It rotates a node 45 degrees and
 *      carries on in a straight line, so the figure LOOKS like it is asking a
 *      question and then shows only one answer.
 *
 * So this contract is edges-first. Nodes say what a thing IS, edges say what
 * leads to what and under which condition.
