/**
 * PEER CARDS — four cards of identical size, because the points are peers.
 *
 * THE ARGUMENT
 *
 * Equal geometry is a CLAIM, and it is the right one more often than the kit
 * currently admits. When a set is four things of the same kind, four boxes of the
 * same size say so without a word: nothing is first, nothing is bigger, and the
 * room is free to read them in any order and compare them against each other. A
 * row stack cannot say that, because top and bottom mean something whether the
 * author intended it or not.
 *
 * This is also the only variant here that puts the four claims SIDE BY SIDE at the
 * same eye height. Comparison is a horizontal act. "A volume outlives the
 * container" only lands next to "a container is one running copy", and in a
 * vertical stack those two are 90px apart with a third claim in between.
 *
 * The icon earns its 34px here for the same reason the term does in `RuleStack`: a
 * card is a small target on a projector, and an icon is what lets a presenter say
 * "the one on the right" and have the room find it in one glance.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS WORST AT
 *
 * **It flattens the lead, and the fixture has one.** The image is the point the
 * other three hang off, and here it is card one of four at exactly the weight of
 * the other three, with a chip that has to SAY "start here" because the geometry
 * cannot. That is a figure arguing with its own content, and it is why
 * `LeadAndRest` exists.
 *
 * Second, and this is the measured limit: **224px of content width is brutal on a
 * claim.** The fixture's longest is 434px of type, so it wraps to two lines and
 * the card allows three. A claim of 60 characters is 592px, which is three lines,
 * and at 65 it is four and the card's declared 18px of padding becomes 0. The
 * resolver's 52-character ceiling on a label is not a style preference here, it is
 * this card's arithmetic. An author who writes a good long claim will find this
 * variant refuses it.
 *
 * Third, it cannot hold a reason longer than about 90 characters. The fixture's
 * 81-character reason already takes three of the four allowed lines.
 *
 * GEOMETRY, AND THE PADDING ARITHMETIC
 *
 * A fixed 1100x290 stage. Four cards 260 wide on a 280 pitch, so the gaps are 20
 * and the last card's right edge is 840 + 260 = 1100 exactly. Cards run y 0 to 254
 * and the caption sits at 262, 26 tall.
 *
 * PADDING IS A FLOOR, NOT A DECLARATION. A box shows `(box - content) / 2`, so
 * CARD_H is derived from the fixture's worst card rather than declared:
 *
 *   icon tile, with the tone chip on the same line   34px
 *   gap                                              10px
 *   term chip, `sm`                                  20px
 *   gap                                               6px
 *   claim, 17px on 22px lines, 3 allowed             66px
 *   gap                                               6px
 *   reason, 13.5px on 19px lines, 4 allowed          76px
 *   ------------------------------------------------------
 *   content                                         218px
 *   CARD_H = 218 + 2 x 18                            254px  -> exactly 18px real
 *
 * Content width is 260 - 2 x 18 = 224.
 *
 *   - The longest claim is 44 characters of 17px Sora bold at about 9.86px each:
 *     434px, which is 1.94 lines in 224, so 2. The third allowed line is headroom
 *     for the 52-character claim the resolver still permits, at 513px or 2.3
 *     lines.
 *   - The longest reason is 81 characters of 13.5px Inter at about 6.75px each:
 *     547px, or 2.44 lines in 224, so 3. The fourth is headroom.
 *   - The tone chip shares the icon's line rather than taking a row of its own,
 *     which is what keeps the content at 218: "this one is free" is about 125px
 *     against the 224 - 34 - 8 = 182px left beside the icon tile.
 *   - The hover aside is 300px wide and centres on its card, so cards 1 and 4
 *     would overhang the stage by 20px. `dx` pulls them back rather than letting
 *     the aside leave the figure.

 * THE ROW IS CENTRED, AND IT USED TO BE PINNED TO x=0. MEASURED.
 *
 * The first version laid cards from the left on a fixed 1100px stage, which is
 * right for the four the fixture has and wrong for everything else: two cards
 * filled the left half and stranded 540px, three stranded 260px, and
 * `align-check.mjs` reports that as DRIFT because the figure's centre is nowhere
 * near the content area's centre. Session 1 v3 hit it on a two-point slide and a
 * three-point slide on the same day.
 *
 * Centred is not a cosmetic fix. `align-check` allows exactly two verdicts, ALIGNED
 * on the header's left edge or CENTRED on the content area, so a centred row of any
 * length is a legal figure while a left-pinned short row is a reported defect.
 *
 * `width` exists for the other half of the same problem: these figures were all
 * built to own a 1100px stage, and a `ContentSlide` that pairs a figure with a
 * points column gives it about half that. Pass the width of the slot it is in.

    out with about 120px of empty card under the text, which is the same defect as
    stranded width and reads the same way.

    Estimated, not measured, for the reason in the metrics note above, and estimated
    generously: a set of equal cards takes the WORST card's line counts, so a card

    A SET OF PEERS STILL BUILDS ONE AT A TIME, and that is not a contradiction. The

                    THE CARD HAS DEPTH NOW, AND IT USED TO BE A FLAT WASH.

                    It was a 4% tint under a 3px rule: correct, legible, and dead. On
                    a projector a row of those reads as four grey boxes with a
                    coloured line on top, which is not what "these four are peers"
                    should look like.

                    Four things, all still opaque and all still from the token ramp:

                      1. A DIAGONAL wash, 10% at the top left falling to nothing by
                         45%, over an opaque white base. Diagonal rather than
                         vertical so the light has a direction, and it agrees with
                         the highlight in 3.
                      2. A tone-tinted SHADOW rather than the house grey one. The
                         kit's own `shadow-card` is a blue-tinted shadow for exactly
                         this reason; a card that is amber should not cast blue.
                      3. A soft radial HIGHLIGHT in the top right corner, 7%, which
                         is what stops a large card reading as flat fill.
                      4. A hairline INNER ring in the tone, over the neutral border,
                         so the edge belongs to the card rather than to the grid.

                    No animation, no blur, nothing that costs layout: this is all
                    paint, so `qa.mjs` and `align-check.mjs` measure exactly what they
                    measured before.
