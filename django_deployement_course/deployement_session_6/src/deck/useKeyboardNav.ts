 *
 * WHY REPLAY IS A KEY AT ALL
 *
 * A built slide is an explanation in sequence, and the commonest thing that goes
 * wrong while teaching it is that the room did not follow the first pass. Before
 * this key the only way back to the top of a build was to leave the slide and come
 * back, which crosses a slide boundary twice and plays two transitions to get to
 * the same place. `R` restages the slide in place.
 *
 * WHY THE ARROW BINDING IS NOW A TOGGLE
 *
 * The original binding was fixed: plain arrows changed slide, Ctrl+arrow stepped
 * the build. That is the right default, because the plain arrows are what gets
 * tapped every few seconds while presenting and one press should mean one slide,
 * with no half-built state.
 *
 * It is the wrong default for a deck whose slides are mostly BUILDS. Six of the
 * figures in the labs step eight or nine times, so on those slides the presenter
 * holds Ctrl for the whole slide and reaches for a plain arrow only once. Worse,
 * a hardware clicker cannot send Ctrl at all, so a build-heavy deck could not be
 * presented from a clicker: it would skip every build in the deck.
 *
 * So the pair swaps, on one key, and the control cluster shows which way round it
 * currently is. It is a swap and not a third mode because both jobs have to stay
 * reachable: an instructor mid-session must be able to skip a slide as well as
 * step one, whichever they chose.
 *
 * PageDown and PageUp follow the PLAIN arrows rather than being pinned to slides,
 * for the clicker reason above: a clicker should do what the presenter just chose,
 * not something a third binding decided for them.

        an instructor pressing `e` on a closed deck silently arming an eraser they
        cannot see. Inside marker mode the presenter has asked for a drawing
        instrument and the letters are theirs.

        key that merely puts the pen down, would eventually throw away the wrong

              from nothing: `Delete` sits beside the arrow cluster on most
              keyboards, and the failure it guards against is not a careless
              instructor but a normal one whose hand was going for something else
              while talking. Every other product's version of this key is a
              single press with no undo (one of them is Shift+A, next to the keys
              that move slides), and wiping the board mid-explanation in front of
              a class is not recoverable socially even when it is recoverable
              technically.

              The second press is the confirmation, so it costs nothing to learn
              and nothing to perform. The window is deliberately short: a stale
              armed state that fires half a minute later is a worse bug than the
              one being fixed. The toolbar's erase-all button stays a single
              click, because pointing at a small button labelled "erase
              everything" is already a deliberate act in a way a keypress is not.

              And it remains undoable either way. This guard is about the press
              nobody meant to make, not about making the action irreversible.
