/**
 * QUESTION — the pause beat. One question, on a card, and nothing else.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN TYPE
 *
 * A question posed to the room was previously written as a `ContentSlide` with
 * a `lead` and no points. That inherits the content layout: the header sits
 * top-left at its usual size and the body well below it is simply empty, so the
 * slide reads as a content slide someone forgot to finish. The question is also
 * set at lead size, which is smaller than the title above it, so the one thing
 * the room is meant to think about is not the largest thing on screen.
 *
 * This type inverts that. There is no header block and no body well: the
 * question IS the slide, set at hero scale.
 *
 * `choices` is the one thing allowed on the card besides the question and its
 * qualifier: the two or three answers the room is picking between, drawn as
 * identical boxes. It replaces the stage direction decks kept printing as a
 * bullet ("say yes or no before the next slide"), which told the room how to
 * behave instead of showing it what it was choosing. The boxes never mark which
 * one is right; the answer is still the next slide.
 *
 * WHY A CARD RATHER THAN BARE TEXT
 *
 * The first version of this type was a centred sentence on an empty canvas. The
 * emptiness was deliberate, but on a projector it read as an unfinished slide
 * rather than as a deliberate pause: nothing on screen said "this frame is a
 * different kind of frame". The card gives the beat an edge and a shadow, and
 * the oversized question mark behind it names the beat without adding a word to
 * read. Everything the room is asked to think about is still one sentence.
 *
 * WHAT IT MUST NOT CARRY
 *
 * No bullets, no figure, no callout, no answer. A question slide exists so the
 * room answers out loud before the next slide responds, and anything else on it
 * is something to read instead of think. If a slide needs supporting content,
 * it is a `ContentSlide` whose lead happens to end in a question mark, and that
 * is a different slide.
 *
 * One question per slide. A compound question ("what happens, and why?") gets
 * split, for the same reason a slide carries one idea.
 *
 * THE VIDEO RECTANGLE
 *
 * x 913..1280, y 0..220 is kept clear for the instructor video. The card is
 * left-aligned and capped at 840px, which is 66% of the canvas and the widest it
 * can be while its right edge still clears x 913. `SlideBase` already applies the
 * px-16 gutter, so this layout adds none of its own: a second one pushed the card
 * to x 128 and off the deck's left datum. It therefore never
 * reaches the rectangle at any height: the layout needs no vertical fudge to
 * stay clear, and a longer question simply grows the card downward. The question mark sits on
 * the right, in the band the card leaves empty. It is `pointer-events-none`, so
 * the checker skips it the way it skips every other decorative layer.
 *
 * The mark is a FLEX SIBLING of the card, not an absolutely-positioned layer:
 * that is what keeps the two optically parallel. Both sit on the row's centre
 * line, so a longer question grows the card in both directions and the mark
 * stays level with it instead of drifting off a hardcoded top offset.
 *
 * THE CARD HAS A FLOOR, AND THAT IS WHAT KEEPS `align-check` QUIET. A card sized
 * purely to its text leaves a deep empty band under it on a short question, which
 * the harness reports as tail drift (over 170px). `min-h-[440px]` with the
 * content centred inside means a one-line question and a three-line one occupy
 * the same block, so the pause beat is the same shape wherever it falls.

                  a reason, the slide has answered its own question and the room
