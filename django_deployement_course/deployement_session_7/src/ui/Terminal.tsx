 * A terminal, in one of two window chromes.
 *
 * The kit's `CodeBlock` is a *file* view (traffic lights, a filename, line
 * numbers), which is wrong for commands: students run these in a terminal, and
 * the thing they actually have to recognise is the window plus the prompt path
 * telling them *which folder* they are in. So this renders real chrome, and each
 * command carries its real `PS <path>>` prompt.
 *
 * One `Terminal` is one terminal. Two terminals means two of these side by
 * side, never two prompts inside one panel.
 *
 * TWO CHROMES, BECAUSE THE WINDOW IS PART OF THE INSTRUCTION.
 *
 * `vscode` (the default) draws the integrated panel, tab strip and all. It is
 * right for the 95% of commands this course runs from inside the editor.
 *
 * `powershell` draws a STANDALONE Windows PowerShell window with a title bar.
 * Session 5 needed it and the review caught the difference: a slide that says
 * "run this in an Administrator PowerShell" while drawing VS Code's panel is
 * telling the room two different things, and the one that matters is the one it
 * draws. A learner who runs an elevated search inside the editor's terminal gets
 * no results.
