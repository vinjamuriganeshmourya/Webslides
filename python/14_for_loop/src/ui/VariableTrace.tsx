/**
 * A program run one line at a time, with its variables drawn as boxes.
 *
 * THE ARGUMENT
 *
 * "Python executes the code line-by-line" is a claim about TIME, and a static
 * code panel cannot make it. This figure lights one line, shows the variable
 * box that line changed, and appends what it printed, one click per line. The
 * source PPTX of Python session 4 drew the same thing as 27 consecutive slides;
 * here each program is one slide and its lines are the build steps.
 *
 * THE BOX IS THE COURSE'S OWN ANALOGY
 *
 * Session 3 taught "variables are like containers for storing values" with a
 * glass that changes from water to juice. The box here has a lid with the name
 * on it and the value inside, and the value swaps in place when a line
 * reassigns it, which is the glass changing colour.
 *
 * STEP MODEL
 *
 * Step 0 is the code alone, nothing lit, no boxes, no output. Click `k` shows
 * `steps[k-1]`: its `line` lit, its `boxes` as the whole state after that line,
 * and its `output` as everything printed so far. `?all` and an instant jump
 * land on the last step. `useClaimedSteps` claims exactly `steps.length` build
 * steps, so the deck's step counter matches the program's line count.
 *
 * DOM, never SVG (content rule 17). Colours from tokens, timing from the scale.
