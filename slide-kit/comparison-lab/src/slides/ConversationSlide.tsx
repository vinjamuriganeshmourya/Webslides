/**
 * CONVERSATION — a two-voice exchange set as a transcript.
 *
 * THE DENSE COUSIN OF `ChatSlide`
 *
 * Same content, different form. `ChatSlide` draws bubbles, which are instantly
 * legible as a conversation and cost about 40% of the slide's width to the empty
 * column beside each message. This draws a transcript: speaker in a fixed
 * gutter, line beside it, full width for the words.
 *
 * So the choice is about length, not taste:
 *
 *   - up to four short turns, and the point is that these are PEOPLE talking
 *     → `ChatSlide`
 *   - five or more turns, or lines that run past a dozen words
 *     → this one
 *
 * A transcript that would fit as bubbles should be bubbles. Bubbles that need
 * six turns should be a transcript. Getting this backwards produces either a
 * wall of grey text or a stack of bubbles running off the bottom of the frame.
 *
 * EXACTLY TWO VOICES
 *
 * `speakers` takes a left and a right and nothing else. Three voices in a
 * teaching transcript is a panel discussion: the room loses track of who holds
 * the correct view, which is the one thing the form is for. A third voice means
 * the content is a `ScenarioSlide`.
 *
 * THE VOICES ARE COLOURED, AND THE COLOUR MEANS SOMETHING
 *
 * Left is muted: the question, the wrong turn, the room's own voice. Right is
 * the tone accent: the answer. Same asymmetry as `ChatThread`, for the same
 * reason — the filled side is the voice the deck wants the room to leave in.
 *
 * THE HEIGHT BUDGET
 *
 * A one-line turn is about 56px and a two-line turn about 84px. The well runs
 * y=220..656 with no lead under the header, so six one-line turns or four
 * two-line turns; a lead costs about 50px of that, which is one turn. `qa.mjs` catches the overflow; the budget is here so it does not have to.

            vertical edge that makes it scannable.

            Capped at 1000px rather than 840: this layout is text-only and its
            tallest content sits well below y=220, so it is not competing with
            the instructor-video rectangle the way a figure would. The cap is
            about line length — 1000px at 22px is a comfortable measure, and the
            full 1152 is not.
