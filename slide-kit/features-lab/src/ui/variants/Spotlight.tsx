/**
 * SPOTLIGHT — the whole list is on screen, and exactly one row is legible.
 *
 * THE ARGUMENT
 *
 * A features slide gets TALKED THROUGH one feature at a time. That is how the
 * session actually runs, and every other layout in this lab ignores it: they put
 * five equally finished tiles up and hope the room happens to look wherever the
 * voice is. It usually does not. People read the whole grid in the first four
 * seconds, finish before the instructor has finished the first capability, and
 * spend the rest of the slide ahead of the talking.
 *
 * So this makes the slide follow the instructor. All five capabilities are
 * listed from the moment the slide arrives, because the room needs to know how
 * many there are and roughly what they cover, but only the current one is opened
 * up: its body, its `outcome`, its full type scale. The other four are one dim
 * line each, present but deliberately not worth reading yet. A click moves the
 * spotlight down the list rather than adding another tile, so what the presenter
 * is saying and what is bright on screen are the same thing by construction.
 *
 * The `outcome` line appears ONLY on the open row. "What it buys you" is a claim,
 * and five claims stacked up read as marketing; one claim, on the thing being
 * discussed, reads as a point.
 *
 * WORST AT: THE COMPARISON, AND THE SLIDE AFTER IT.
 *
 * This is a genuinely bad figure for any slide whose job is "look at these
 * together". If the audience has to weigh feature two against feature four, or
 * count what the set covers, they can never see both at full strength at once,
 * and the layout is actively fighting them. It is also the only variant here
 * whose FINAL frame is not its best frame: when the presenter reaches the last
 * capability, the four above it are collapsed, so a screenshot of the finished
 * slide, a PDF export, or anyone reading the deck alone afterwards gets one
 * legible feature and four headings. Every other variant in this lab ends
 * complete. And it needs a presenter: dropped into a self-serve deck with no one
 * clicking, it opens showing a single feature and looks broken.
 *
 * GEOMETRY
 *
 * A fixed 1100px stage on a 1280x720 slide. Full width and no columns is the
 * point: a row that has the whole stage does not need to abbreviate, so the open
 * feature's body and outcome each sit on one line rather than wrapping.
 *
 *   open row       132px
 *   collapsed row   48px
 *   gutter           8px
 *   five rows      132 + 4 * 48 + 4 * 8 = 356px, caption at 368, figure 392
 *
 * THE TOTAL HEIGHT DOES NOT DEPEND ON WHICH ROW IS OPEN. Exactly one row is open
 * at any time, so the stack is `ROW_OPEN + (n - 1) * ROW_SHUT` whatever the
 * spotlight is doing, and the caption underneath never moves. A figure whose own
 * height changed under the presenter would walk the caption off the bottom of
 * the video-safe rectangle on the last click.
 *
 * Padding is a floor, not a declaration: a card shows `(box height - content
 * height) / 2`, and `py-3.5` means nothing once content outgrows the box. The
 * open row stacks a 17px label, a 13px body and a 12px outcome pill to about
 * 80px, so its real padding is ~26px, and ~17px if the body takes a second line.
 * The collapsed row holds one 13px line in 48px, so ~16px. The floor is 12.
