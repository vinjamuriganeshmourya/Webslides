/**
 * ANNOTATED SHOT — the product itself, with each claim pinned to the region of
 * the screen that proves it.
 *
 * THE ARGUMENT
 *
 * Every other variant in this lab describes the software. This one shows it. For
 * a technical audience that is not a small difference: an icon and a sentence
 * asserting "live data, not fixtures" is a claim, and the same words with a
 * leader line landing on the product row Django actually returned is evidence.
 * The established practice around annotated interface figures is the shape of
 * this whole variant, and it is three rules rather than one:
 *
 *   1. **Annotate only when the interface cannot explain itself.** The pins are
 *      not decoration and there are three of them, not nine. A capture where
 *      every element wears a numbered dot teaches the room to ignore numbered
 *      dots, which is the same reason `Shot`'s own `highlight` prop is singular.
 *   2. **Crop to the relevant workflow.** The capture arrives cropped. Nothing in
 *      this component crops, scales or retouches, because hard rule 11 says a
 *      capture that is wrong gets captured again rather than edited.
 *   3. **Let the real UI carry the weight.** The screenshot is 620x360 of a
 *      1100x400 stage and it lands FIRST, on beat 0, before a single claim is
 *      made about it. The room looks at the thing, then at what is being said
 *      about the thing.
 *
 * The callout cards are a column on the right rather than floating over the
 * capture. A card sitting on top of the interface hides the pixels it is talking
 * about, and on a projector a white card over a white product page has no edge at
 * all. So the pin is on the image, the words are off it, and the correspondence is
 * carried twice: by the NUMBER, which survives any distance, and by a short
 * leader line, which is what makes the number worth looking up.
 *
 * IT IS THE ONE VARIANT THAT CANNOT SHARE THE LAB'S FIXTURE, AND THAT IS ITS COST
 *
 * Every other candidate here renders `noteAppFeatures`, so picking a winner is a
 * rename. This one cannot. It pins claims to regions of a real capture, so its
 * features have to be features OF THE THING IN THE PICTURE, and the note app has
 * no picture: it is a deliberate stand-in, hard rule 11 forbids inventing a
 * screenshot of it, and hard rule 8 forbids annotating an unrelated capture with
 * unrelated claims. So it renders `storefrontFeatures` instead, which is a real
 * screen from deployment session 1.
 *
 * **That is this variant's main cost rather than a gap in the lab.** It cannot be
 * judged like for like against the other five, and it is judged only on whether
 * the form is worth having. And the cost generalises past the lab: the variant is
 * UNUSABLE anywhere no real capture of the actual product exists. There is no
 * degraded mode, no mockup, no "close enough" screenshot of something similar,
 * because both of the rules above forbid exactly those. A features slide about
 * software nobody has run yet has to use one of the other five.
 *
 * WHAT ELSE IT IS WORST AT
 *
 *   - **Anything abstract.** "Offline first" has no pixels. A capability that is
 *     an architectural property rather than a visible element has nowhere to pin,
 *     and a pin planted near it anyway is the dishonest version of this figure.
 *   - **Ageing.** The capture is a version of a real product, so the figure goes
 *     stale the first time that screen is redesigned, and a stale capture on a
 *     slide is worse than no capture. Nothing else in this lab can rot.
 *   - **Room for words.** Each card is 440x96 and holds one line of label, one of
 *     body and one of outcome. There is no `metric`, no `without`, and a wrapped
 *     body eats the padding floor (see GEOMETRY). The capture takes the space.
 *   - **Legibility from the back.** The capture is shown at 620px wide, so 13px
 *     UI text inside it renders around 8px on the stage. The pins have to land on
 *     regions the room can SEE at that size, which is why they are on product
 *     images, titles and prices rather than on a form label.
 *   - **More than about four claims.** Leader lines start crossing, and a
 *     crossed leader is read as pointing at the wrong thing.
 *
 * WHY IT DOES NOT USE THE KIT'S `Shot`
 *
 * `src/ui/Shot.tsx` is the right component for a capture on a normal slide and
 * the wrong one here, for two reasons that are both structural rather than
 * cosmetic. Its image is `h-auto w-full`, so the height follows the width and
 * cannot be pinned into a fixed 360px band of a fixed 400px stage, which is what
 * every harness in this lab measures. And its `highlight` is deliberately
 * SINGULAR, with a good argument attached: one box per capture, added only when
 * the crop alone does not put the claim under the eye. This variant needs n
 * pins, which is precisely the thing `Shot` declines to offer.
 *
 * What is copied from it is the part worth copying: the amber. `Shot` uses
 * `#F59E0B` for its box because amber reads as "look here" on both light and dark
 * captures and collides with neither the deck's blue nor terminal green. That is
 * `colors.warning`, and every pin, leader and number badge here is that token, so
 * a deck using both components marks captures in one colour.
 *
 * GEOMETRY, AND THE PADDING ARITHMETIC
 *
 * A fixed 1100x400 stage, absolutely positioned.
 *
 *   capture   left 0    top 0   620 x 360
 *   cards     left 660  width 440, three of 96 on a 16px gap = 320,
 *                       centred in the 360 band, so tops are 20, 132, 244
 *   caption   top 376
 *
 * 620x360 is 1.7222 and the capture is 1310x760, which is 1.7237. `object-contain`
 * in a fixed frame therefore letterboxes by about 0.15px on each side rather than
 * distorting, and PINS ARE POSITIONED AGAINST THAT RENDERED IMAGE BOX rather than
 * against the figure: a percentage of 620 and 360, so a change to the frame size
 * moves every pin with it and a change of capture at the same aspect needs no new
 * numbers.
 *
 * Card content, at 440 wide with `px-3.5` (14) and a 22px number badge on a 10px
 * gap, leaves a 380px text column. The fixture's longest strings set to one line
 * each in it ("One component per product" at 15px is about 197px, "The API sends a
 * number, React renders currency" at 12px is about 284px), so:
 *
 *   label    15px on 1.25   18.8
 *   gap                      3
 *   body     12px on 1.4    16.8
 *   gap                      4
 *   outcome  12px on 1.35   16.2
 *   ---------------------------------
 *   content                 58.8
 *
 * and the REAL vertical padding is (96 - 58.8) / 2 = 18.6px, against a floor of
 * 12. `py-3.5` DECLARES 14; what a box SHOWS is `(box height - content height) /
 * 2`, and the declared value silently becomes 0 or negative once the content
 * outgrows the box. The sibling flow-chart lab shipped four cards at 0px and one
 * at -7px, every one declaring 12px, and passed every harness the whole time.
 *
 * The 18.6 leaves 6.6px of slack, which is NOT a second line: one wrapped body
 * costs 16.8 and lands the real padding at 10.2px, under the floor. So the
 * constraint is one line per field, and that is the honest limit of this layout
 * rather than something to be fixed by nudging a number.

 *
 *   live   20.5 / 74     just above the first product's title, not on it. The claim is that
 *                        every card is a row the API returned, and a product
 *                        NAME is the part of the screen that could only have come
 *                        from the database. Pinning the grid as a whole would
 *                        point at a layout, which is the next claim's job.
 *   grid   82.4 / 54.5   the THIRD product image. "One component per product" is
 *                        a claim about repetition, and repetition is only visible
 *                        at the far end of it: the third identical card proves
 *                        there is one component, the first proves nothing.

 *                        exactly where client-side formatting is visible.
 *
 * An `id` with no entry here is a PROBLEM and is reported, not parked at 50/50:

        THE POPOVER IS NEVER IN THE DOM UNLESS IT IS OPEN.

        `qa.mjs`, `video-safe.mjs` and `align-check.mjs` measure static DOM
        rectangles. A panel parked at `opacity: 0` gets measured, gets reported as
        overflowing the frame or intruding on the instructor-video rectangle, and
        is wrong every single run. `AnimatePresence` keeps it out of the tree.

        It also means the slide is complete without it: the room cannot hover a
        projector, so `detail` is the presenter's aside and never the teaching.

        The z-index that lets it paint over its neighbours lives on
        `.fc-node-slot`, which `FcNodeIn` puts on the wrapper: this element's
        parent animates `transform`, and a transformed element creates a stacking
        context that a `z-index` in here can never escape.
