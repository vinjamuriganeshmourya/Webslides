/**
 * METRIC LED — the number leads and the name supports it.
 *
 * THE ARGUMENT
 *
 * Every other variant in this lab leads with the capability's NAME, which means
 * the eye has to read a phrase before it knows whether this tile is worth its
 * attention. A number does not have to be read: it is the one thing on a slide
 * the eye finds without being told where to look, which is why established
 * practice for a metric-led layout is to set the figure at display scale and
 * demote the words to a caption under it. "40ms" arrives before "Search
 * everything" does, and then the label explains what the 40 was about.
 *
 * That only works if the rest of the surface stays quiet. So there are no filled
 * cards on the supporting side, one hairline of structure, and exactly one
 * accent colour, all of it spent on five numerals. The hero's figure is set
 * larger again, because a field of five equal numbers is the flat grid the whole
 * lab exists to replace.
 *
 * A FEATURE WITH NO NUMBER SAYS SO. `metric` is a separate field on the contract
 * and not a formatting hint on `outcome` for exactly this reason: the honest
 * failure mode of a metric-led layout is a manufactured metric. Where the field
 * is absent this variant draws a short muted bar and the words "no figure for
 * this one", which is ugly on purpose. It should push the author to either find
 * the number or pick a different variant, and it must never invent a "2x".
 *
 * WHAT IT IS WORST AT
 *
 *   - **A feature set whose numbers are not comparable.** This fixture is the
 *     case: "40" is milliseconds, "100" is a percentage, "0" is a count and
 *     "every" is not a number at all. Set at one size, in one colour, in one row,
 *     the layout asserts that they are five readings of the same instrument. They
 *     are not, and no amount of unit text under them fixes it. Use this only
 *     where the figures share a dimension or are so obviously unlike that no
 *     comparison is implied.
 *   - **Numbers of very different LENGTH.** "every" is five glyphs at 88px on the
 *     hero and "0" is one, so the optical weight of a cell has nothing to do with
 *     the strength of its claim. The longest value the small cells can hold at
 *     34px is about ten glyphs; past that it wraps and the figure loses its grid.
 *   - **A set with no honest metrics at all.** Four "no figure for this one"
 *     panels is a worse slide than a plain card grid, and this variant will
 *     cheerfully draw it.
 *   - **Mechanism.** It states outcomes and never explains one. `body` is a
 *     single 11.5px line and `detail` is behind a hover the room cannot reach.
 *
 * GEOMETRY, AND THE PADDING ARITHMETIC
 *
 * A fixed 1100 x 354 stage on a 1280x720 slide, absolutely positioned. The hero
 * is a 428px panel on the left and the four supporting features are a 2x2 field
 * of 316px cells to the right of it: 428 + 24 channel + 316 + 16 + 316 = 1100
 * exactly, so no column carries a rounding remainder. Cell rows are 150px on a
 * 16px gutter, so the right field is 316 tall and the hero panel matches it.
 *
 * THE METRIC SLOT IS A FIXED HEIGHT, and that is what makes the padding
 * arithmetic hold whether or not an item has a number. `SLOT.hero` is 110px (an
 * 88px numeral on 1.0, a 4px gap, a 14px unit line on 1.3) and `SLOT.cell` is
 * 50px (34px numeral, 2px gap, 11px unit on 1.3). The "no figure" fallback draws
 * a 3px bar plus the same unit line inside the same box, so it cannot change any
 * height below.
 *
 * Padding is a floor, not a declaration: a box SHOWS `(box height - content
 * height) / 2`, and a declared `py-4` silently becomes 0 or negative the moment
 * content outgrows the box. The sibling flow-chart lab shipped four cards at 0px
 * and one at -7px, all of them declaring 12px, and passed every harness for
 * weeks. So both boxes here are sized from the content, against this fixture's
 * longest label, "Plain files on disk", plus its body line:
 *
 *   cell   150px   50 slot + 8 gap + 17.5 label (14px on 1.25) + 3 gap
 *                  + 15.5 body (11.5px on 1.35) = 94  ->  (150 - 94) / 2 = 28px
 *   hero   316px   110 slot + 12 gap + 26.4 label (22px on 1.2) + 4 gap
 *                  + 19.6 body (14px on 1.4) + 8 gap + 26 outcome pill = 206
 *                  ->  (316 - 206) / 2 = 55px
 *
 * The floor is 12px and the worst case is 28, so a label OR a body can gain a
 * whole line anywhere in the field before the padding is even threatened. At
 * 14px bold, "Plain files on disk" is about 130px wide inside 284px of usable
 * cell, so nothing in this fixture wraps in the first place.
 *
 * 316 grid + 14 + 24 = 354, and the caption sits on the last of that.
