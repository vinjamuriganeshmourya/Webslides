/**
 * RADIAL SPREAD — one thing, reaching into many, with the reaching drawn.
 *
 * THE ARGUMENT
 *
 * "It does all of this" is a claim about BREADTH, and breadth is the one thing a
 * grid states without showing. Five equal cards say "here are five things"; they
 * leave the room to infer that all five come from the same place, which is the
 * entire point of the slide. A centre with spokes draws it: one origin, five
 * destinations, and the lines between them are the sentence.
 *
 * The motion is the argument too. A hub-and-spoke figure that arrives complete is
 * a picture of reach; the same figure with each spoke DRAWING outward is the act
 * of reaching. That is why every spoke is `FcEdgeDraw` (a real `pathLength`
 * trace, at `linear`, so the line reads as travelling rather than as an
 * entrance running out of energy) and never a fade.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS WORST AT
 *
 *   - **It has nowhere to put `body`.** A spoke card is 78px, which holds a label
 *     and one wrapped supporting line, and this variant spends that line on
 *     `outcome`, because "what each area gains" is what makes breadth an argument
 *     rather than a list. `body` moves into the hover popover, and the room
 *     cannot hover a projector. **So this is the wrong figure whenever the
 *     mechanism is the teaching**, and the right one whenever the coverage is.
 *   - **The centre is not in the contract.** `FeaturesFigureProps` has `items`
 *     and `caption` and no name for the thing they belong to, so the hub falls
 *     back to the count. See THE HUB below; it is a real gap, not a styling
 *     choice.
 *   - **Order.** Spokes have no sequence, and anything laid out on a ring will be
 *     read as a cycle by somebody. Never use it for steps.
 *   - **Alternatives.** Every spoke leaves the same centre, so they read as things
 *     it does, never as things you choose between.
 *   - **Three items.** A centre with three spokes is a lot of ceremony for a
 *     list, and with two it is a comparison drawn oddly.
 *
 * WHAT CAME FROM THE PYTHON SESSION'S VERSION, AND WHAT CHANGED
 *
 * `python_programming/programming_with_python/src/ui/RadialSpread.tsx` is the
 * original, written for one slide ("Python has applications in almost every
 * field"). This is that idea generalised onto the lab's shared contract.
 *
 * KEPT, because each was learned the hard way there:
 *
 *   - Spokes are SVG and carry NO text; every label is a DOM element. That file
 *     records why (content rule 17), and its own arc was found to be too wide only
 *     because a screenshot showed "Backend Development" cut in half while all
 *     three harnesses passed.
 *   - The arrowhead's placement lives on a static `<g>`, never on an animated
 *     element. framer-motion writes an inline `transform` every frame and that
 *     overrides an SVG `transform` attribute, which stacked all five arrowheads
 *     at the origin. Here it is `FcArrowDefs` plus the transparent second path
 *     inside `FcEdgeDraw`, which solves the same problem in the lab's own idiom.
 *   - The line stops SHORT of what it points at, so the arrowhead has air.
 *
 * CHANGED:
 *
 *   - **The hub prop is gone.** That version took `hub` and `hubLogo`; the shared
 *     contract has neither, and the whole point of the lab is that picking a
 *     winner is a rename at the call site. See THE HUB.
 *   - **Percentage layout became a fixed stage.** It scaled a 660x420 box with
 *     `pct()` and `aspectRatio`, so no real padding could be reasoned about. This
 *     is 1100x400 in absolute pixels for the same reason every box here is: a
 *     card's real padding is `(box - content) / 2`, and you cannot check that
 *     against a percentage.
 *   - **A fan became a ring.** Its spokes fanned across a narrow +/-44 degree arc
 *     from a left-hand hub, because 660px of width was all it had. 1100x400 fits
 *     a full ring on an ELLIPSE, which uses the whole stage and makes "in every
 *     direction" literal instead of "off to the right".
 *   - **`stepped` is gone and every part is a build step.** That version defaulted
 *     to auto-play and its `stepped` mode called `useReveal()` once per spoke.
 *     `useReveal()` in a loop does not work in this kit, and the lab's
 *     `useBeats(count)` is the fix.
 *   - **The ring, the pulse and the `E.pop` overshoot are gone.** Three ornaments
 *     per spoke are affordable when a figure plays itself once; they are noise
 *     when the presenter is pressing a key and waiting for an answer.
 *   - **Hover, weight and hero are new**, because the contract has them and that
 *     file's `Spoke` did not.
 *
 * THE HUB
 *
 * The contract names no subject, so the centre states the only thing it can know
 * for certain: how many capabilities are on the spokes. That is true of any
 * `items` array and invents nothing. **The honest fix is a `subject` field on
 * `FeaturesFigureProps`**, and it is deliberately not added here, because a lab
 * variant that quietly widens the shared contract stops being comparable with the
 * other five.
 *
 * GEOMETRY
 *
 * A fixed 1100x400 stage. The hub is an 80px-radius disc at (500, 190). Spokes
 * sit on an ellipse of rx 400 / ry 138 about that centre, which is the shape of
 * the space rather than a circle squashed into it, and the hero's rx is 1.13x so
 * its spoke is visibly the longest. Angles are `i * 360 / n` with the hero at 0
 * degrees, which puts the lead capability on the right, where the eye leaves the
 * hub.
 *
 * The cards are 256x78 and that number is the padding floor, not a taste. The
 * worst content is a 14px label on 1.25 (17.5) plus a 3px gap plus a 11.5px
 * outcome that wraps to two lines on 1.3 (30), which is 50.5px, so the REAL
 * vertical padding is (78 - 50.5) / 2 = 13.75px. `py-3.5` DECLARES 14px and a
 * declaration means nothing: what a box shows is `(box - content) / 2`, and the
 * sibling flow-chart lab shipped four cards at 0px and one at -7px, all of them
 * declaring 12px, all of them passing every harness. The hero card is 86px on the
 * same arithmetic at 16px / 12px type.
 *
 * With those numbers the lowest card ends at y=360, the highest starts at y=20,
 * and the caption sits at 376. Nothing on the ring reaches the hub: the two lower
 * cards start 12px below the disc and the two upper ones end 12px above it.

/**
 * ONE SPOKE'S CARD, WITH THE HOVER.
 *
 * The pattern is the flow-chart lab's `NodeShell`, copied deliberately rather
 * than imported, because that shell is sized for a 180px column and this is a
 * 256px card on a ring:
 *
 *   - `fc-node fc-node--hoverable` for the lift. That is a CSS transition in
 *     `index.css` at UI-tier speed, gated behind `hover: hover` so a tap does not
 *     leave a card stuck raised. The figure's own entrance is explanatory and
 *     twice as slow, on purpose; reusing 520ms on a hover feels broken.
 *   - The popover is framer, because it mounts and unmounts and needs an exit,
 *     and it is NEVER in the DOM unless open: all three harnesses measure static
 *     rectangles, and a panel parked at `opacity: 0` is reported as overflowing
 *     the frame every single run.
 *   - `transform-origin` faces the card, so it grows out of it.
 *
 * The z-index that lifts it over its neighbours belongs to `.fc-node-slot` on
 * `FcNodeIn`'s wrapper, because that wrapper animates `transform` and therefore
 * creates a stacking context nothing inside it can escape.
