/**
 * LAYER ANATOMY — the features as strata of ONE artefact, seen with depth.
 *
 * THE ARGUMENT
 *
 * Every other variant here draws the features as peers: tiles, rows, spokes,
 * columns. That is the right drawing for a set of independent capabilities and it
 * actively LIES about the other case, which is just as common. Some feature sets
 * are not a set at all: they are one thing with parts, and the parts sit on each
 * other. "Plain files on disk" is not a sibling of "Search everything", it is
 * what search is standing on. A grid puts them side by side at equal size and
 * tells the room they are alternatives to be picked between.
 *
 * So this is a stack, and the vertical order carries the argument. SURFACE AT THE
 * TOP, FOUNDATION AT THE BOTTOM: the layer the person actually touches is the one
 * they meet first, the layer everything rests on is drawn last and heaviest. That
 * direction is chosen deliberately over the reverse. Bottom-first is the right
 * order for a build sequence, where nothing above exists yet; but a features
 * slide is answering "what is this thing", and the honest answer starts at the
 * part the person has their hands on. It also agrees with the kit's own
 * `LayerStack`, which takes its layers top-first so the array reads the way the
 * figure looks.
 *
 * The horizontal offset is the reason this is not five rows. Each layer steps
 * 26px to the right of the one above it and a drawn diagonal joins their left
 * edges, so what the eye reads is the side wall of a single solid: one object cut
 * open, not five bars in a column. Take the offset away and it collapses back
 * into a table, which is the failure mode this variant exists to avoid.
 *
 * HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM THE KIT'S `LayerStack`, AND WHY IT IS NOT JUST THAT ONE
 *
 * `slide-kit/slide-template/src/ui/LayerStack.tsx` already draws a stack, and it
 * is the right component for what it does. It is a 300px flex column of flat
 * bars, sized to stand two or three abreast so two machines can be compared
 * layer by layer, and its meaning lives in a four-value `state` enum: which layer
 * `ships`, which is supplied by the `host`, which one `breaks`, which is
 * `shared`. It is a DIAGNOSTIC figure about deployment, no layer leads, and there
 * is no depth: every bar is the same width and the same x.
 *
 * This one is a different job on the same shape. It is a full-stage 1100px
 * figure, it takes `FeatureItem`s rather than `Layer`s, so it carries `label`,
 * `body`, `outcome`, `icon` and a hover `detail` per stratum where `LayerStack`
 * carries a label and a short note. It has a hero, which is the whole point of
 * this lab's contract and which `LayerStack` has no way to express. It has the
 * horizontal offset and the drawn side wall, so it reads as ONE artefact instead
 * of a column of independent bars. And it is click-gated through this lab's
 * `useBeats`, where `LayerStack` wraps each bar in a `Step`.
 *
 * Making `LayerStack` do all that would mean giving it a second content contract,
 * a hero, a depth mode and a per-layer hover, at which point it is two components
 * sharing a name and the deployment sessions that depend on its `state` enum pay
 * for a features figure they never asked for. Keeping them apart is cheaper than
 * one component with a mode switch.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS WORST AT
 *
 *   - **A set with no real ordering.** This is the honest failure, and it is the
 *     mirror of the grid's: the geometry INSISTS that the top rests on the bottom,
 *     and the room will believe it. This fixture is only borderline defensible,
 *     because plain files on disk genuinely do underlie the other four. Feed it
 *     five unrelated capabilities and it invents an architecture, which is a
 *     worse lie than drawing them as peers.
 *   - **Its own reveal order.** Beat 0 belongs to the hero because the slide has
 *     to arrive with its subject on screen, and here the hero is the SURFACE
 *     layer. So the stack assembles downward, which reads as excavation rather
 *     than construction: the room watches the thing being dug under rather than
 *     built up. Bottom-up would read better as motion and would cost the hero its
 *     free beat, and the hero mattered more.
 *   - **Comparison, and counting.** Layers are 760px wide and 66px apart, so
 *     "which of these is the fastest" is unanswerable, and a stack of six starts
 *     reading as a list with an offset bug.
 *   - **Long `outcome` copy.** The right column is 260px, which holds two lines at
 *     13px. A third line eats the padding floor (see the arithmetic below), and
 *     that failure is silent.
 *
 * GEOMETRY, AND THE PADDING ARITHMETIC
 *
 * A fixed 1100 x 398 stage, absolutely positioned. Layers are 760px wide and step
 * `DX = 26` right per level, centred on x = 190, so the top layer sits at 138 and
 * the bottom at 242 and the widest right edge is 1002: the offset never leaves the
 * stage, and the 138px gutter on the left carries the two axis words.
 *
 * Padding is a floor, not a declaration. A box SHOWS `(box height - content
 * height) / 2`, so a declared `py-3.5` silently becomes 0 or negative the moment
 * the content outgrows the box, and the sibling flow-chart lab shipped four cards
 * at 0px and one at -7px, all of them declaring 12px, passing every harness the
 * whole time. Both layer heights here are therefore derived from the content,
 * measured against this fixture's longest label, "Plain files on disk", plus its
 * body line:
 *
 *   layer   66px   18.75 label (15px on 1.25) + 3 gap + 16.2 body (12px on 1.35)
 *                  = 38  ->  real vertical padding (66 - 38) / 2 = 14px
 *   hero    82px   22.8 label (19px on 1.2) + 3 gap + 17.55 body (13px on 1.35)
 *                  = 43.35  ->  (82 - 43.35) / 2 = 19.3px
 *
 * The floor is 12px and the worst case is 14, so the sizes are tight rather than
 * comfortable and the doc comment is the only thing standing between the next
 * editor and a 0px card. The right-hand `outcome` at two lines is 35.1px, still
 * under the 38px the label column already claims, so it does not move the floor.
 * The text column is 760 - 40 padding - 26 icon - 12 gap - 260 outcome - 16 gap =
 * 406px, and the longest body in the fixture sets at about 264px, so nothing
 * wraps.
 *
 * 82 + 4 x 66 + 4 x 4 of gap = 362, the caption sits at 374, the figure is 398.
 * The gap is 4px rather than 0 because touching layers read as one filled block
 * and the strata stop being countable; it is not 12px, because a stack with air
 * between its layers is a column of separate bars again.
