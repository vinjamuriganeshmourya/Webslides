/**
 * LANE FLOW — the swimlane. The vertical axis is WHO, not when.
 *
 * THE ARGUMENT
 *
 * Every other variant in this lab answers "what happens next". This one answers
 * "and whose job is that", which is a different question and often the more
 * useful one. A step's row is its owner, so handoffs become visible as vertical
 * moves: the figure shows that the work crosses from the learner to a machine to
 * a human three times, and that every crossing is a place it can stall.
 *
 * Established practice for cross-functional processes, and the reason the lane
 * names in the fixture are roles rather than departments: "Reviewer" over
 * "Review", "Grading service" over "System". A lane labelled with a noun tells
 * you nothing about who to chase.
 *
 * WHEN IT IS THE WRONG CHOICE
 *
 * When every step has the same owner. Three lanes with all six nodes in the
 * middle one is a spine flow that has thrown away a third of its height. The
 * contract makes `lane` optional for exactly that reason, and this variant is
 * the only one that reads it.
 *
 * GEOMETRY
 *
 * Lanes are discovered from the nodes in first-appearance order, so the caller
 * controls the vertical order by writing the fixture in process order. Columns
 * are the spine position, which keeps time on the horizontal axis: mixing "later"
 * and "someone else" on one axis is what makes a bad swimlane unreadable.

    ROUTING, THIRD ATTEMPT, AND THE FIRST TWO FAILED IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

    Attempt one went `H midX V enterY` and simply STOPPED there, a column short
    of the target: every arrowhead floated in open space.

    Attempt two added the final leg but kept turning horizontally FIRST. The
    columns are only 14px apart, so the turning column landed PAST the entry
    point and the last leg ran backwards. On screen that is an arrowhead pointing
    left, out of the node it was supposed to be entering.

    So a lane change exits VERTICALLY. Down (or up) out of the source's own
    column, across the intervening space at the target's row, then straight into
    the target's left edge. The vertical leg is the handoff, which is exactly the
    thing this variant exists to show, and it needs no gap between columns at all.

    A same-lane edge is a plain horizontal run, because there is no handoff.
