/**
 * CALL FLOW — the handover is the subject, and the snippets are the evidence.
 *
 * THE ARGUMENT
 *
 * For a request path, WHAT HANDS TO WHAT is the lesson. A file map states
 * adjacency and calls it a day: it can say `urls.py` and `views.py` both exist
 * and are next to each other, and adjacency is not causation. This variant spends
 * the whole stage on the thing a map leaves out. Five compact cards in a chain,
 * each carrying its file, its `title` and its real snippet, and between every
 * consecutive pair a drawn connector with `via` riding it: "GET /api/products/",
 * "calls", "lazy queryset", "reads Product", "defines".
 *
 * The connector hops OVER the top of the cards rather than running between them,
 * for a measured reason: the gaps are 25px and "GET /api/products/" is about
 * 110px wide, so a label centred in a gap either overlaps the cards or gets
 * shrunk to illegibility. In the band above the cards it has 225px of clear room
 * per hop, and the label is the whole point of the variant, so the label wins the
 * geometry argument and the connector routes around it.
 *
 * TWO STOPS IN ONE FILE, WHICH THE FIXTURE HAS AND WHICH BROKE THE FIRST LAYOUT
 *
 * Stops 2 and 3 are both in `products/views.py`, one on the function and one on
 * the queryset line. Five equal cards in a row implies five files, and the room
 * would leave believing the project has five, which is a false statement about
 * the codebase. Three things say otherwise, and they are derived from the data
 * (`stops[i].file === stops[i + 1].file`), never hardcoded to index 1:
 *
 *   1. A tinted PLATE is drawn behind the pair, extending 8px past both cards, so
 *      the two read as one region. It costs no height because it sits behind.
 *   2. That plate is labelled "one file", left-aligned at x = the plate's left
 *      edge so it clears both connector legs, which stand at the card centres
 *      337 and 562.
 *   3. The connector across the pair is DASHED and carries no arrowhead. An
 *      arrowhead between two cards means control left one file and entered
 *      another, and here it did not: it moved two lines down the same function.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS WORST AT
 *
 * THE CODE. Every card is 200px wide, so the code column is 106px and
 * `    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=8, decimal_places=2)` wraps to
 * three visual lines. Wrapped Python with a broken indent is genuinely harder to
 * read than the same lines in `TourStops`' 776px panel, and the worst card shows
 * ten visual lines for five real ones. Nothing is hidden, which is why wrapping
 * beat clipping, but this figure is for the room that needs the chain; anybody
 * who needs to READ the queryset line needs the other variant.
 *
 * Second, it answers "what happens next" and not "where does this live". There is
 * no persistent map here at all: the layer colour is the only clue to a file's
 * place in the project, and a chain cannot show that `serializers.py` sits beside
 * `models.py` rather than after it.
 *
 * DID IT USE THE KIT'S `CodeBlock`? NO. Two reasons, both fatal here. Its gutter
 * is hardcoded `{i + 1}`, and four of five stops do not start at line 1, so it
 * would tell the room the view body is at the top of its file. And it carries a
 * traffic-light title bar plus a language chip, which is about 40px of chrome per
 * card, five times over, on a figure whose entire budget is 400px. The local
 * renderer below is a `[gutter, code]` CSS grid, so a number cannot drift off its
 * own line.
 *
 * GEOMETRY, AND THE PADDING ARITHMETIC
 *
 * A fixed 1100x322 stage, and it was 384 while the cards still carried code. Each
 * handover owns a tier: 22, 36, 50, 64, with its `via` pill centred on its own line.
 * Cards are 200 wide on a 225 pitch (0, 225, 450, 675, 900, last right edge exactly
 * 1100), top 84, height 176, bottom 260. The plate reaches 268, its badge hangs
 * under that, and the caption is derived from the same expression rather than typed,
 * so it cannot go stale when the cards move: 84 + 176 + 8 + 26 = 294. The toggle
 * sits on that line, left, in its own reserved 210 x 28 box.
 *
 * PADDING IS A FLOOR, so CARD_H is checked against the fixture's worst card rather
 * than declared. Content width is 200 - 28 (px-14) = 172.
 *
 *   number and file chip             19px   (10px text on 1.3, plus 3px x 2)
 *   gap                               6px
 *   title, 3 lines allowed           48px   ("And the model is where it all
 *                                            resolves" is 37 chars at 12.5px
 *                                            semibold, about 259px, so 2 lines
 *                                            in 172; the third is headroom)
 *   gap                               6px
 *   body, 2 lines                    31px   (11.5px on 1.35; the fixture's longest
 *                                            body is 59 chars, about 348px, so 2)
 *   line range                       13px   (10px mono, pushed down by `mt-auto`)
 *   ------------------------------------
 *   content                         123px
 *   CARD_H 176 - 2 x 14 = 148       ->  25px of slack, which `mt-auto` puts above
 *                                       the range line rather than under the text,
 *                                       so the declared 14px stays real

  ONE LEVEL PER HANDOVER, AND THIS WAS A REPORTED FAULT.

  Every connector used to run at the same y, which looked tidy and was not: an
  elbow ended by dropping into card i + 1 at its centre, and the next elbow left
  that same card from the same centre, so at every card the arrowhead coming in and
  the line going out were drawn on top of each other. Four hops, three collisions,
  and the arrows read as one continuous zig-zag rather than as four handovers.

  Two changes together, and neither works alone:

    1. **A TIER PER HOP.** Hop 0 runs at 22 and each one after it drops 14, so the
       staircase funnels down into the last card. No two horizontal runs share a y,
       and the labels that ride them cannot collide either.
    2. **THE LEGS STEP OFF CENTRE.** A hop leaves at `cx + 14` and arrives at
       `cx - 14`, so the outgoing leg and the incoming arrowhead at one card are
       28px apart instead of superimposed. This is the half that actually removes
       the overlap: tiers alone would still stack the legs.

  The lowest tier is 64 and the cards start at 84, so the shortest leg is 20px,
  which is enough for a 3px line and its arrowhead to read as a turn.

 * back from the room. The layer hue still lives on each card's top rule, where it
 * identifies the file. The path is one weight and one colour, because it is one

                  THE CODE CAME OUT, AND THAT IS THE FIX RATHER THAN A RETREAT.

                  A 106px code column at 10px wrapped nearly every line of this
                  fixture two to four times: `align-check.mjs` reported 28
                  wrapped tokens on this one slide, and
                  `price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=8, decimal_places=2)`
                  came out over four visual lines. Wrapping was the right call
                  against clipping, because a clipped line silently claims the
                  code ends where the card does. But the honest conclusion from
                  the measurement is that five snippets do not fit side by side
                  on a 1280px stage at any legible size, and a figure that shows
                  code the room cannot read is not showing code.

                  So this variant does what its own argument says it is for: the
                  HANDOVER. File, claim, and the mechanism on the line between.
                  The line range is still named, so the room knows where to look,
                  and `TourStops` is the variant that shows the lines themselves.
                  Two figures, two jobs, rather than one figure doing both badly.
