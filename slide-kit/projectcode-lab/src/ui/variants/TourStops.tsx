/**
 * TOUR STOPS — a small map that never leaves, and one snippet at a time beside it.
 *
 * THE ARGUMENT
 *
 * This is the form the walkthrough literature actually describes: a guided tour,
 * with snippets as points of interest ON A MAP. The map is four rows down the
 * left, one per file, carrying the path and the `role` and tinted by `layer`. It
 * is on screen from the first frame and it never changes size. The right two
 * thirds is the current stop: its `title` as a claim, its `body`, and the sliced
 * snippet at a size a back row can read.
 *
 * Every click advances one stop. The map marks where you ARE and where you have
 * BEEN, so the question "which file is this" is answered by a glance sideways
 * rather than by remembering the slide before. That is the thing four separate
 * code slides structurally cannot do: each of them is a file with no map, and the
 * room is asked to hold the project's shape in its head while reading code.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS WORST AT
 *
 * THE HANDOVER. `via` is not drawn anywhere. The map states which files exist and
 * the tour states their order, and neither of those is causation: nothing on this
 * figure says the URL pattern DISPATCHES to the view, only that the view comes
 * next. A room watching this can finish the tour able to name all four files and
 * still not be able to say what calls what. `CallFlow` exists for exactly that
 * failure.
 *
 * Second, it shows ONE snippet. Two stops cannot be compared side by side, so
 * "the field list here must match the model there" is a sentence the presenter
 * says, not a thing the slide shows.
 *
 * DID IT USE THE KIT'S `CodeBlock`? NO, AND THIS IS THE REASON.
 *
 * `CodeBlock` renders its gutter as `{i + 1}`, hardcoded. A snippet whose numbers
 * start at 1 tells the room this code is at the top of its file, which for four
 * of the fixture's five stops is false: the view body starts at line 8. Honouring
 * `snippet().from` would mean editing a kit-owned file, so the panel below is a
 * 30-line local renderer: a CSS grid of `[gutter, code]` rows, which also
 * guarantees a number can never drift off the line it belongs to. The cost is the
 * syntax highlighter, and it is the right trade: a wrong line number is a false
 * statement about the codebase, and colour is a nicety.
 *
 * GEOMETRY, AND THE PADDING ARITHMETIC
 *
 * A fixed 1100x390 stage. Map column 300 wide, 24px gutter, snippet panel 776
 * wide at x=324. Both run from y=0 to y=350, and the caption sits at 366.
 *
 * PADDING IS A FLOOR. A box shows `(box - content) / 2`, so every height below is
 * derived from the fixture's longest string rather than declared and hoped for.
 *
 *   MAP ROW. Content width 300 - 28 (px-14) - 48 (two pips) - 8 = 216.
 *   `products/serializers.py` is 23 chars at 12px mono (0.6em = 7.2px) = 166px,
 *   one line. The longest role, "What a product IS, and the table behind it", is
 *   42 chars at 11px (~5.4px) = 227px, which is WIDER than 216, so it wraps to
 *   two. Content = 15.6 + 3 + 2 x 14.85 = 49px. ROW_H 74 gives (74 - 49) / 2 =
 *   12.5px real against 12px declared. Four rows on an 82px pitch: 30, 112, 194,
 *   276, ending at 350.
 *
 *   SNIPPET PANEL. Content width 776 - 40 = 736. Chips 22 + 8 + title (2 lines of
 *   19px at 1.3 = 49) + 6 + body 22 + 12 + code panel (28 header + 5 lines at
 *   14px x 1.6 = 112 + 24 pad = 164) = 283px. PANEL_H 350 leaves 67px of slack,
 *   which the code panel absorbs with `flex-1` rather than leaving a hole, so the
 *   declared 20px stays real. Worst case ceiling is 350 - 40 = 310 > 283.
 *
 *   The longest snippet line, `    data = ProductSerializer(products, many=True).data`,
 *   is 54 chars at 14px mono = 454px, well inside the 696px of code column, so
 *   nothing wraps and nothing scrolls.
