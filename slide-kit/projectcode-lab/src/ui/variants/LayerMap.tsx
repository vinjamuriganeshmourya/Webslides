/**
 * LAYER MAP — the project by architectural layer, with the tour plotted onto it.
 *
 * THE ARGUMENT
 *
 * Some questions are "where does this live", not "what happens next", and a chain
 * cannot answer them. `CallFlow` can tell the room that the view calls the
 * serializer and still leave them unable to say which of the four files they
 * would open to add a field, because a chain has no place: it only has order.
 *
 * This draws the place. One band per `layer` in the fixture's own order, routing
 * at the top and data at the bottom, each band naming its file and its `role` and
 * holding one colour for the whole deck. Colour per layer is the single most
 * useful aid the walkthrough literature names, on the grounds that it is how a
 * reader identifies a module WITHOUT re-reading its name, and the colour here is
 * a function of the layer's index in `resolveProject().layers`, so routing is the
 * same blue in all three variants of this lab.
 *
 * The tour is then plotted across the bands, left to right in stop order, joined
 * by a drawn line. The shape of that line IS the lesson: the fixture descends
 * from the URL to the table, so the line steps steadily downward and the room can
 * see that a GET request is a descent through the stack. The router draws a
 * return leg the same way when a later stop sits in a higher band, so a tour that
 * comes back up, a serializer reaching for a model it has already visited, draws
 * as a climb rather than being flattened.
 *
 * Two stops in the same file need no special case here, and that is a real
 * property of this layout rather than luck: stops 2 and 3 are both
 * `products/views.py`, so they plot on the SAME band and the segment between them
 * is horizontal. A horizontal move means "still in this file", a vertical one
 * means "you have changed layer", and the room learns that distinction from the
 * geometry without being told.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS WORST AT
 *
 * THE CODE, almost entirely. A stop is a 62px chip carrying its number and its
 * line range. There is no snippet on this figure at all, so it cannot teach a
 * single line of Python: it is a map to be read before or after the code, never
 * instead of it. Put it on the slide that introduces the app and leave the
 * teaching to `TourStops`.
 *
 * Second, it collapses to nothing when a project has one file per layer and one
 * stop per file, because then the band and the chip say the same thing twice. It
 * needs a layer that is visited more than once to earn its height, which the
 * fixture only just provides.
 *
 * Third, it is honest about `via` and therefore silent about it: the segments are
 * unlabelled. Labelling five segments at four different heights puts text in the
 * gaps between bands, where there are 10px, so the mechanism of the handover is
 * `CallFlow`'s job and this figure does not pretend to it.
 *
 * DID IT USE THE KIT'S `CodeBlock`? NO, and unlike the other two variants it did
 * not want to. There is no snippet on this figure. `resolveProject().snippet` is
 * still called, for the one thing this layout does show about the code: the chip
 * reads the sliced snippet's own `from` and length, so "L8 to L12" is derived
 * from the same slice the other variants render rather than from the raw range,
 * and a chip can never disagree with a panel about which lines a stop is.
 *
 * GEOMETRY, AND THE PADDING ARITHMETIC
 *
 * A fixed 1100x392 stage. Column headers at y=6. Four bands 74px tall on an 84px
 * pitch (30, 114, 198, 282), so the last band ends at 356 and the caption sits at
 * 366. The layer name column is 168px, the band body starts at 178. Stop chips
 * are 62 wide on an 84 pitch starting at x=660, so the fifth chip ends at 1058,
 * inside the 1084 the band's own 16px padding allows.
 *
 * PADDING IS A FLOOR. A box shows `(box - content) / 2`, so BAND_H is checked
 * against the fixture's longest strings rather than declared:
 *
 *   Band text block is 440px wide (194 to 634), which is what keeps it clear of
 *   the plot area at 660. `products/serializers.py` is 23 chars at 12px mono
 *   (0.6em = 7.2px) = 166px, one line. The longest role, "What a product IS, and
 *   the table behind it", is 42 chars at 11px (about 5.4px) = 227px, comfortably
 *   one line in 440. So content = 15.6 + 4 + 14.85 = 35px, and BAND_H 74 shows
 *   (74 - 35) / 2 = 19.5px of real vertical padding against 14px declared.
 *
 *   The 30px chip is shorter than the 35px text block, so it never sets the band
 *   height and the padding cannot be squeezed from that side. The layer name is
 *   the other candidate: "request handling" is 16 chars at 13px bold (about
 *   8px) = 128px against 152px of column, so it stays one line and contributes
 *   16px, under the 35px the text block already claims.
