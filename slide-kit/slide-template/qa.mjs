/**
 * THE TYPE FLOOR. 16px, and it is `body-sm`, the smallest body step in
 * `tailwind.config.ts`.
 *
 * WHERE THE NUMBER CAME FROM. `src/ui/isolation/isolationFigure.ts` exports it
 * as `MIN_TEXT_PX`, with the reason: the first pass of that figure family set
 * machine names at 15px, verb phrases at 11.5px and the slide's own conclusion
 * at 13px, and the review's verdict was that the concept's punchline had become
 * the SMALLEST text on the frame. A deck is read from the back of a room and
 * again, alone, from a recording, so text below the floor is not a style choice,
 * it is unreadable content. The lab's rule is that the figure fits the type, not
 * that the type shrinks to fit the figure.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A HARNESS CHECK AND NOT JUST A FIGURE CONTRACT. Session 6 slide 8
 * rendered the concept's conclusion at roughly 7px inside a figure, and
 * `video-safe.mjs`, `align-check.mjs` and this file all passed it. It was caught
 * by a human looking at a screenshot. A contract that only one figure family
 * imports cannot catch that; a sweep over the rendered DOM can.
 *
 * Keep this in sync with `MIN_TEXT_PX`. Two constants, one rule, and this repo
 * has already paid three times for a constant that encoded another constant's
 * old value.

/**
 * The 15px kicker is the ONE exemption, and it is deliberately narrow.
 *
 * `text-kicker` is a named step in the type scale at 15px: uppercase, 0.14em
 * tracked, the section label that sits above almost every slide title. Flagging
 * it would put a finding on nearly every slide in every deck, and a report that
 * fires everywhere is a report nobody reads.
 *
 * It is matched by its rendered SIGNATURE — 15px AND uppercase AND visibly
 * tracked — not by its class name, so a 15px SENTENCE is still a finding. That
 * is the point: `align-check.mjs` records at length that an exemption which
 * fires by accident is worse than no harness, because it is believed. Widen this
 * and you re-open the 7px hole.

/**
 * The deck's own chrome is UI, not content, so it is not held to the floor: the
 * control bar's slide counter is `text-[11.5px]` on purpose, the nav and marker
 * buttons carry icon-sized glyphs, and the footer mark is a logo.
 *
 * TWO MECHANISMS, because one is not enough on its own:
 *
 *   1. The sweep walks `<section>`, and the control bar is not inside it — it is
 *      painted over the stage by `SlideStage`, as `align-check.mjs`'s CHROME
 *      table exists to describe. The footer IS inside the section (it is
 *      `SlideBase`'s own element, a sibling of the content region), so it is
 *      excluded by ancestor.
 *   2. The geometric zones below, copied from `align-check.mjs`, catch anything a
 *      future refactor moves inside the section. Measured in stage coordinates
 *      at 1280x720; re-measure them there, not here, if the bar changes.

  It is reported in its own block and deliberately does NOT feed `issues`, so it
  cannot change the slide-1-and-last-slide baseline every session is signed off
  against.

  WHY. Two figures in the KIT break the floor today: `src/ui/figures/FanOut.tsx`
  sets its copy notes at 11.5px and `src/ui/MachineBoundary.tsx` uses `text-xs`
  (12px). A hard failure would therefore fail every deck that renders either one,
  for a defect the deck's author did not write and cannot fix from a session —
  `sync-kit.mjs` would overwrite the fix. A gate that a deck cannot pass by doing
  its own work correctly gets routed around, and then the whole harness is.

  WHEN IT BECOMES A FAILURE. When those two figures are raised to 16px in the kit
  (a kit PR, per `KIT.md`), fold `tinyCount` into `issues` above and delete this
  paragraph. Until then a 7px punchline is VISIBLE in the output, which is the
  whole gap this check was added to close — it was invisible before.
