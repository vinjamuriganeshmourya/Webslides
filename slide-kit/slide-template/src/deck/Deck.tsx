    starts from `hidden` again, and the build plays exactly as it did on arrival.

    had already moved the ref forward, so continuity collapsed to nothing, the

              system, so a circle drawn round a word in a window is still round that
              word on the projector and after a fullscreen toggle.

              and gets replaced on every navigation AND on every replay. Ink mounted
              in there would be destroyed by the very key that replays the build, so
              pressing R would silently wipe the annotation the presenter had just

              MOUNTED WHILE THE MARKER IS OPEN *OR* THE SLIDE HAS INK, WHICH IS NOT
              THE SAME CONDITION AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE FEATURE.

              An instructor draws on a build, puts the pen down, and advances the
              build. Gating the layer on `active` alone erases the drawing from the
              screen the moment they close the marker, so the annotation they made to
              explain the slide vanishes exactly when they start talking about it.
              Gating it on `hasInk` as well keeps the ink on the slide and lets the
              pen go away, which is what a whiteboard does.

              It is still ABSENT from the DOM in the case that matters for the
              harnesses: a deck nobody has drawn on. An inert full-stage overlay would
              be reported by `qa.mjs` as content that scrolls and by `video-safe.mjs`
              as covering the instructor video, on every slide of every deck, and
              `qa.mjs` never draws. The layer itself also drops `pointer-events` when
              the marker is closed, so ink on screen never eats a click.
