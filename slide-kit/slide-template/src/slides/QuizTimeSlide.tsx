/**
 * QUIZ TIME — an announcement frame, not a question frame.
 *
 * This slide carries no question, no options and no answer. It exists to mark
 * the switch from "listen" to "answer", so the room looks up before anything is
 * asked. The question itself is asked from the quiz tool, which means the deck
 * never holds a second copy of it that can drift out of sync, and no answer is
 * ever sitting on a slide the room has already seen.
 *
 * LAYOUT
 * Two halves on one shared centre line: the announcement on the left, the
 * character on the right, each vertically centred in its own half. Nothing is
 * placed by eye. The character sits on a soft disc that anchors it to the
 * composition, rather than floating free in the corner.
 *
 * The character is given an EXPLICIT width. `Illustration name="quiz"` renders
 * an absolutely-positioned scene (question mark right, character left), so a
 * `w-auto` box collapses to zero width and the two pieces pile onto the same
 * spot, which is what made the art read as randomly scattered. The box below
 * fixes both width and height, so the scene composes the way it was drawn.

/**
 * THE FIGURE, IN FOUR LAYERS, ENTERING AS ONE.
 *
 * The art is one Canva illustration, but it is shipped as four separately keyed
 * PNGs — brain, bulb, bubble, question mark — that share ONE canvas. Because
 * every file is the same size and the same crop, stacking them with
 * `absolute inset-0` recomposes the original exactly; nothing has to be
 * positioned by hand, and nothing drifts when the stage is resized. That is the
 * only reason the split still exists.
 *
 * IT USED TO BE A SEQUENCE, AND IS NOT ANY MORE. Each layer had its own delay
 * and its own `from` offset, so the scene told a four-beat story: the brain is
 * there, a question arrives, the mark pops, the idea lights up. Four beats over
 * roughly 2.2s is a long time to hold a room on a slide whose entire message is
 * the two words in the heading, and the layers were arriving out of stacking
 * order, so the bulb appeared to slide out from behind the bubble. The figure
 * now enters as one composed image, carried by its stage container, which is
 * the single animation on this half of the slide.
 *
 * `z` is stacking order and is all these entries still need to carry.
