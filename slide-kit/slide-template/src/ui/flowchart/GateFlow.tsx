/**
 * GATE FLOW — the decision is a barrier the work has to get past, not a box in the row.
 *
 * THE ARGUMENT
 *
 * Every other variant in this lab draws the decision as one more card in a
 * sequence: same height, same silhouette, same weight as the steps around it. So
 * the room reads it as a step that happens to have two arrows, and the fork is
 * carried entirely by the arrows.
 *
 * This one gives the decision physical extent. The steps run left to right at
 * card height; the decision is a tall narrow bar standing ACROSS the line, 60px
 * wide and 190px tall, taller than everything it interrupts. The happy path is
 * drawn passing THROUGH it and out the far side. The failing path is ejected out
 * of the bar's underside and travels back leftward on a lower track to the step
 * it retries.
 *
 * The claim: a checkpoint is a place, not an activity. Nothing gets to the right
 * of the bar without being let through, and the picture says that with geometry
 * instead of asking the reader to infer it from two arrowheads. It is the shape
 * of a toll gate, a customs desk, a CI gate, which is what these decisions
 * usually are in the processes we teach.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS WORST AT
 *
 * **A chart with two decisions.** The whole effect depends on the bar being the
 * only tall object on the stage, and on there being one lower track underneath
 * it. Add a second gate and you get two barriers competing for the same
 * "everything must pass me" reading, plus two ejection paths that have to share
 * one lower lane; the second one either crosses the first or needs a third
 * vertical level the 380px stage does not have. This variant renders the FIRST
 * decision as a gate and would have to demote any others to ordinary cards,
 * which is exactly the inconsistency it exists to remove.
 *
 * Second, narrower failure: the question does not fit in the bar. A 60px column
 * cannot hold "All checks pass?" at any readable size, so the question is set as
 * a DOM label ABOVE the gate, and its tie to the bar is proximity alone. Give it
 * a question longer than about six words and the label grows wider than the gap
 * between the two cards it sits between, and starts to look like a title for the
 * whole figure rather than the gate's own text.
 *
 * GEOMETRY
 *
 * A fixed 1100x380 stage. Cards are 176px wide, the gate column is 60px, gaps
 * are 46px throughout, so five spine slots measure 948px and sit on a 76px
 * margin each side. The card row is 92px tall with its centre line at y=150; the
 * gate spans y=55 to y=245, overhanging the row by 95px top and bottom, which is
 * the overhang that makes it read as a barrier rather than a tall step. The
 * lower track sits at y=296, and the retry card is parked directly under the
 * step it returns to so the loop home is a single straight vertical.
