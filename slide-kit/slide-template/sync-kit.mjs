 * sync-kit.mjs — apply this template's kit to a session, or report the drift.
 *
 *   node sync-kit.mjs --check  ../../django_deployement_course/deployement_session_1_v2
 *   node sync-kit.mjs --apply  ../../django_deployement_course/deployement_session_1_v2
 *   node sync-kit.mjs --check  ../../django_deployement_course/deployement_session_1_v2 ../../django_deployement_course/deployement_session_2
 *
 * WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A SHARED PACKAGE
 *
 * Each session is a standalone Vite app that must keep building on its own,
 * years after it was recorded, and `npm run build:html` has to emit ONE
 * self-contained file. A workspace package that every session imports would give
 * automatic propagation, and that is exactly the problem: an archived session's
 * rendered output would change underneath it whenever the kit moved. Sessions
 * are deliverables, not consumers. So propagation is a deliberate command, and
 * `--check` exists so nobody has to remember which sessions are behind.
 *
 * WHAT IS KIT AND WHAT IS THE SESSION'S OWN
 *
 * `KIT` below is the shared rendering layer: components, tokens, motion, the
 * player, the harnesses and the build config. `--apply` OVERWRITES those in the
 * target. Anything not matched by KIT is never read and never written, which is
 * how a session keeps its content:
 *
 *     src/decks/           the deck itself, and activeDeck.ts pointing at it
 *     src/export/revealSteps.ts   generated per deck
 *     src/export/deckCss.ts       generated per deck
 *     deck.config.json     name, title, slide count
 *     public/shots/        that session's real screenshots
 *     workflow/            plans, captures, previews, sign-offs
 *     package.json  CLAUDE.md  README.md  dist*  node_modules
 *
 * `--check` is read-only and exits 1 when anything is behind, so it works in a
 * pre-flight. `--apply` prints every file it writes and backs up nothing: the
 * repo is the backup, so run it on a clean tree.

 * kit file that nobody listed is caught by `--check` reporting it as untracked
