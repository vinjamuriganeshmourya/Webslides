/**
 * PSEUDO TO REAL — the bridge, and the two lines that have nothing on the far side.
 *
 * THE ARGUMENT
 *
 * Pseudocode earns its slide only if the learner can see it become code. So the
 * algorithm sits on the left, the real implementation on the right, and each real
 * line is DRAWN AT THE Y OF THE PSEUDOCODE LINE IT IMPLEMENTS, with a connector
 * between them. The pairing is not left to the room to work out from two blocks
 * of text sitting side by side, which is what a pair of `CodeBlock`s would be.
 *
 * `real.map` is authored, never guessed: `map[realIndex]` is the pseudocode line
 * that real line implements. Guessing it by index would pair `print(largest)`
 * with `END IF` and teach the wrong thing with total confidence.
 *
 * THE ABSENCE IS THE TEACHING, AND IT IS SHOWN HONESTLY
 *
 * Pseudocode lines 6 and 7, `END IF` and `END FOR`, HAVE NO REAL COUNTERPART.
 * Python closes a block by ending the indentation, so there is nothing on the
 * right for them to point at. That is not a hole in the figure, it is the single
 * most useful thing on the slide: it is where the room learns that the shape of
 * the pseudocode and the shape of the code are not the same shape.
 *
 * So those two rows get their own beat, their own marker on the right ("Nothing
 * here"), and their own hover note saying why. What this figure must never do,
 * and what a naive index pairing does by default, is invent a partner for them or
 * quietly skip them so the reader never notices two lines went missing. The
 * fixture's comment says exactly this, and the figure is built to obey it.
 *
 * WHY THE REAL SIDE IS NOT `CodeBlock`, WHICH IS THE ONE PLACE IT WOULD BE LEGAL
 *
 * The contract's rule is that pseudocode must not go through `CodeBlock`, and the
 * right-hand side here is not pseudocode: it is real Python, it will become a
 * file, and a language chip on it would be TRUE. So `CodeBlock` was allowed, and
 * it is still not used, for one reason that has nothing to do with taste: this
 * figure has to light ONE real line at a time and place each real line at an
 * arbitrary y, and `CodeBlock` renders a block. The asymmetry the reader sees is
 * therefore honest anyway: the left panel is labelled "Pseudocode" and carries no
 * language, the right panel is labelled `python` and does, which is the whole
 * claim the slide is making.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS WORST AT
 *
 * **It only draws a one-to-one map.** Two real lines implementing the same
 * pseudocode line would be placed at the same y and would draw on top of each
 * other, so that case is a listed problem rather than a render. Real code
 * collapses and expands against pseudocode constantly, and the honest version of
 * this figure for a many-to-one algorithm does not exist yet.
 *
 * **The right column is mostly air.** Five real lines occupy a panel scaled to
 * eight pseudocode rows, because the rows have to line up. That is the cost of
 * the alignment being geometric rather than described, and it is a bad trade on
 * an algorithm where the pseudocode is twice the length of the code.
 *
 * Third: **the connector is the weakest part on a projector.** It is a 140px
 * horizontal line in a gap, and at the back of a room the reader may be doing the
 * pairing from the shared y rather than from the line. That is why the active pair
 * is tinted on BOTH sides and not only joined.
 *
 * GEOMETRY, AND THE PADDING ARITHMETIC
 *
 * A fixed 1040x368 figure on the 1280x720 slide. Left panel 460, a 140px
 * connector gap, right panel 440: 460 + 140 + 440 = 1040.
 *
 * PADDING IS A FLOOR, NOT A DECLARATION. A box shows `(box height - content
 * height) / 2`, so both panels are SIZED FROM the content:
 *
 *   - Panel height = 14 + header 22 + 12 + 8 rows of 34 + 14 = **334**, so the
 *     real vertical padding is exactly **14px** by construction. Both panels take
 *     the same height because the right one's rows are positioned at the left
 *     one's y values, which only works if the two grids are identical.
 *   - A row is 34px and holds one 15px mono line on 1.35 leading (20.25px), so
 *     **6.8px** above and below.
 *   - Left code column. Inner width 460 - 32 = 428. The longest line, "SET
 *     largest TO first item of numbers" at 36 characters of 15px mono (9px each),
 *     needs 324, plus a 26px gutter and a 10px gap: 360. 68px spare, which pays
 *     for `indent` being drawn at 18px a level.
 *   - Right code column. Inner width 440 - 32 = 408. The longest real line,
 *     "        largest = item" at 22 characters including its own leading spaces,
 *     needs 198. The leading spaces are real characters in the string and are
 *     preserved by `whitespace-pre`, because on the REAL side the indentation IS
 *     the syntax.
 *   - The "Nothing here" marker is 26px tall inside a 34px row, so **4px** above
 *     and below, and it is deliberately smaller than a code row: it is an absence,
 *     not a step.
 *   - Connectors run from x 466 to x 592 at each row's centre, and the caption
 *     sits at y 342, 26px tall, clearing both panels by 8.
 *
 * All of it is re-derived from the props at render, and a failure is a listed
 * problem. The sibling lab's five cards declared 12px of padding and showed 0px,
 * 0px, 0px, 0px and -7px, for as long as the arithmetic lived only in a comment.
