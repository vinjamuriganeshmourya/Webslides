/*
 * PROMOTED FROM THE FIGURE LABS, AND THIS IS THE ONE COPY.
 *
 * `flowchart-lab`, `pseudocode-lab`, `projectcode-lab`, `points-lab` and
 * `features-lab` each carried a byte-identical copy of this file, which is exactly
 * the drift those labs exist to avoid: five figure families that differ in
 * GEOMETRY must not also differ in tempo, or comparing them compares the wrong
 * thing. `src/ui/flowchart/motion.tsx` is now a re-export of this module rather
 * than a sixth copy.
 *
 * The one edit made on promotion: the labs write `T.draw` where the kit's
 * `figureTiming.ts` calls the same 600ms value `T.drawStep`. Same number, so no
 * figure changes behaviour; the kit's name wins because the kit also keeps a
 * longer `T.draw` for auto-playing figures.

/**
 * SHARED MOTION FOR EVERY VARIANT IN THIS LAB.
 *
 * THE CHOREOGRAPHY RULE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT
 *
 * Lifted from `slide-kit/flowchart-lab`, where the rule was that a flow chart's
 * content IS its order, so the figure assembles along the path. A features slide
 * is a SET rather than a sequence, so the rule here is weaker but not absent:
 * the hero lands first because it is what the slide is about, and the rest
 * follow in authored order.
 *
 * At the fork, the exits are deliberately not simultaneous:
 *
 *   1. the happy path draws first, at full weight
 *   2. the exception branch draws next, quieter
 *   3. the loop back draws last
 *
 * That ordering is the established practice ("the main process flow should be
 * visually dominant, with alternative outcomes easy to compare") expressed in
 * time rather than only in colour. The room follows the straight-through story
 * once, then sees what happens when it fails.
 *
 * `beat()` turns a step index into a delay so a variant never writes its own
 * arithmetic and all six keep one tempo.
 *
 * THE TIER
 *
 * Explanatory, from `figureTiming.ts`: entrances 520ms, staggers 130ms, draws
 * 860ms, whole figure assembled in about 2.4s. These are roughly double the
 * `animate` skill's UI numbers, on that skill's own instruction that explanatory
 * motion can run longer. Nobody triggers a slide figure and nobody repeats it;
 * it is read once from the back of a room while someone talks over it.
 *
 * REDUCED MOTION IS HANDLED HERE, AND THE CSS BLOCK DOES NOT COVER IT
 *
 * `src/index.css` clamps `animation-duration` and `transition-duration`, which
 * is the right thing for CSS. framer-motion animates by writing inline styles
 * frame by frame, so that block does not touch any of this. Every primitive
 * below reads `useReducedMotion()` and mounts at its final state, keeping the
 * figure legible while removing the movement.
 */

/**
 * CLICK-GATED BEATS: the figure builds one step per click, in beat order.
 *
 * A flow chart is a sequence, and an instructor talks through a sequence one
 * stage at a time. Auto-playing the whole thing on slide entry hands the room
 * the finished picture about 2.5 seconds in, whatever the instructor has
 * actually reached, and there is no way to hold on the decision while it is
 * being discussed.
 *
 * `useClaimedSteps` registers `count` build steps with the deck's `Stepper` and
 * returns which of them have been reached, so a part gates on `shown[at]` and
 * the same `at` that used to be a delay is now a click index. Nothing else in a
 * variant changes.
 *
 * It exists because `useReveal()` called in a loop does NOT work: every beat
 * claimed the same order, the whole figure appeared on the first click, and the
 * slide reported one step so the arrow key advanced to the next slide instead of
 * building this one.
 *
 * A variant must compute `count` from its own `nodes`/`edges` and never from
 * state, so the number of registered steps is stable while the slide is up.
 *
 * Under `?all` every `useReveal()` returns true, so all three harnesses still
 * measure the finished figure.
