/**
 * RULE STACK — one full-width row per point, in the order they become sayable.
 *
 * THE ARGUMENT
 *
 * A point is a CLAIM plus the one line that earns it, and a claim needs a line of
 * its own. This is the only variant here that gives it one: 802px of text column,
 * which is enough for the fixture's longest claim at 20px and its longest reason
 * at 15px to each stay on ONE line. Nothing wraps, so nothing has to be read
 * twice, and the eye travels straight down a stack of four claims in the order the
 * instructor will say them.
 *
 * That order is the second half of the argument. A points set in this course is
 * usually not four peers: it is four things that become sayable one after another,
 * and the fixture is exactly that, the image before the container before the
 * volume. A row stack states the sequence by existing. The ordinal in the marker
 * column makes it explicit rather than implied, so a room that looks up halfway
 * knows which point is being discussed.
 *
 * NO ICONS, DELIBERATELY
 *
 * `PeerCards` next door spends 34px of every card on one. Here the marker column
 * carries the TERM, which is the word the learner will type, and an icon beside a
 * term is decoration competing with the only mnemonic on the row. A variant that
 * gives up the icon has to be better at words, so this one is.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS WORST AT
 *
 * **It states an order whether or not there is one.** Four rows read top to
 * bottom, and a set of genuine peers, three ways to do the same thing, comes out
 * looking like three steps. There is no geometry here that can say "these are
 * interchangeable", and an author who does not notice will teach a sequence that
 * does not exist. That is `PeerCards`' entire reason to exist.
 *
 * Second, and measurable: **at six rows it is a wall.** Six rows on this 90px
 * pitch is 532px, which does not fit the 400px budget at all, so the honest
 * ceiling is four and the resolver's cap of six is reachable only by the two
 * variants that lay points out sideways. A five-row set fits at 442px and is
 * already more grey than a room will read.
 *
 * Third, the row is 1100px wide and the text stops at 802: the right third of
 * every row is empty unless the point carries a tone. That is air the card
 * variants spend on content.
 *
 * GEOMETRY, AND THE PADDING ARITHMETIC
 *
 * A fixed 1100x386 stage. Four rows of 82 on a 90px pitch, so the gaps are 8 and
 * the last row ends at 352; the caption sits at 360 and is 26 tall.
 *
 * PADDING IS A FLOOR, NOT A DECLARATION. A box shows `(box - content) / 2`, so the
 * row height is derived from the fixture rather than declared and hoped for:
 *
 *   claim, 20px on 1.3 leading                    26.0px
 *   gap                                            4.0px
 *   reason, 15px on 1.45 leading                  21.75px
 *   ----------------------------------------------------
 *   content                                       51.75px
 *   ROW_H 82 shows (82 - 51.75) / 2 =             15.1px real, against 14 declared
 *
 * Horizontally: 18 (row padding) + 132 (marker) + 22 (gap) + 802 (text) + 96
 * (tone chip) + 30 (gap and right padding) = 1100 exactly.
 *
 *   - The marker holds an ordinal (about 14px) plus a `md` TermChip. The longest
 *     term is "Container", 9 characters of 12.5px mono at 0.6em = 67.5px, plus
 *     20px of chip padding and 2px of border: 90px. With the ordinal and its 8px
 *     gap that is 112px inside 132.
 *   - The longest claim is 44 characters of 20px Sora bold at about 11.6px each:
 *     510px inside 802, so it stays one line with 292px spare.
 *   - The longest reason is 81 characters of 15px Inter at about 7.5px each:
 *     608px inside 802, also one line, with 194px spare.
 *   - "this one is free" is the longest tone word, 16 characters of 10.5px bold
 *     uppercase with tracking, about 109px plus 16px of padding: 125px. It is
 *     allowed to overrun its 96px column into the 30px gap, which is why the gap
 *     is 30 and not 12.
