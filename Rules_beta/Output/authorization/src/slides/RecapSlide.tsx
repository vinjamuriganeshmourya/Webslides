          BOTTOM ALIGNED, AND SMALLER THAN IT LOOKS LIKE IT SHOULD BE.
          This column straddles x=913, which is the left edge of the reserved
          instructor-video rectangle (x 913..1280, y 0..220). Centred at h-[78%]
          the mascot's head reached y≈115 and `video-safe.mjs` reported it 372px
          into the reserved area. Pinning the figure to the floor and capping it
          at 66% puts its top at roughly y=243, clear of the rectangle with room
          to spare. Do not re-centre it: the mascot is the only element in the
          kit tall enough to reach up there, and the harness is the only thing
          that would notice.
