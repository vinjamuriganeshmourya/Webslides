/**
 * STATUS LIST — points that each carry a verdict.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A `BulletList`
 *
 * A bullet list says "here are four things". This says "here are four things
 * AND here is which of them is safe". The verdict is the content, so it cannot
 * be a colour applied to a bullet after the fact: each row is a card whose rail,
 * tint and glyph all carry the same verdict, which is what makes it readable at
 * projector distance and in greyscale.
 *
 * Reach for it when the slide is a set of outcomes, a do/don't pair, or a list
 * of states a command can leave you in. If every row would be `success`, it is a
 * `BulletList` and the colour is decoration.
 *
 * WHY NOT `Callout`
 *
 * `Callout` is ONE box that must not be missed, sitting beside other content.
 * Four callouts stacked read as four things that must not be missed, which is
 * none of them. This is the list form, deliberately quieter per row.
 *
 * COLOUR COMES FROM THE TAILWIND SCALE, NOT FROM HEXES
 *
 * `success` / `warning` / `danger` / `info` each ship a 100 (tint) and a 600
 * (ink) step in `tailwind.config.ts`. Using the classes rather than literals is
 * what keeps this figure in step with `Callout`, which names the same four
 * verdicts, and means a palette change lands in one file.
 */

/**
 * `error` is the authored name and `danger` is the palette's name for the same
 * red. The slide author should be writing what the row MEANS, and a failing
 * command is an error rather than a danger, so the mapping lives here instead of
 * leaking the palette's vocabulary into every deck.
