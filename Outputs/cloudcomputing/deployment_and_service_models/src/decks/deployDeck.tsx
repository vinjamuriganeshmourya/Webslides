/**
 * CLOUD COMPUTING · "Deployment & Service Models" (session 2)
 *
 * Built from `Outputs/cloudcomputing/session_plans/deployment_and_service_models/plan.md`
 * (signed off on the user's standing word, 2026-10-23). The source is the
 * reference deck `Reference ppt's/deployment-and-service-models 2.html`, used
 * for its CONTENT only: every title, kicker, lead, bullet, table cell, label,
 * analogy label and claim on these slides is the reference's own string; the
 * speaker notes are its TR speaker notes and TR analogy lines.
 *
 * THE DESIGN is the plan's: every figure is isometric (`figures/iso/`), drawn
 * to the TR's Visual Guidance or the TR's own diagram, and runs a short loop
 * whose motion explains the slide. No cast, no clay (the user: ignore session
 * 1's illustration style). No builds: every beat is on screen when the slide
 * opens (`revealEveryStep`), and every element enters in reading order
 * (`figures/entrance.ts`, session 1's 1.5s timing).
 *
 * THE USER'S THIRTEEN POINTS on the reference (2026-10-23) are applied here
 * and listed in the plan's decision 2: breakers with the title only, the
 * analogies redesigned, 9 / 12 / 19 / 27 / 29 / 31 drawn to the TR, the lead
 * and the body as one block, the `Stack layer` heading on 25, the table's
 * words moved up from 26 into 25's slabs, 35's points under their lead, 45
 * as two columns.
