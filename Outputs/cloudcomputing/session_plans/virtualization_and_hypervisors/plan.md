# Virtualization & Hypervisors · slide-wise plan

STATUS: signed off on the user's word, 2026-10-27 (the request is the spec: rebuild the reference deck's
content verbatim in the session 1 and 2 format, plan and execute in one run, as sessions 2 and the AWS deck).

- **Session:** cloud computing, `Outputs/cloudcomputing/virtualization_and_hypervisors/`, port 5273.
- **Source:** `Reference ppt's/virtualization-and-hypervisors 2.html`, 62 frames, a kit-built deck. CONTENT ONLY:
  every kicker, title, lead, bullet, table cell, label and caption is the reference's string, unchanged,
  unshortened, nothing added. Rendered and dumped first (text, notes, screenshots, embedded marks).
- **TR doc:** `Reference ppt's/3. Virtualization & Hypervisors.pdf`. Comparison only, never a content source.
  Its 18 VirtualBox screenshots (pages 17-26) are the images the reference's walkthrough frames name
  (`vbox-01` to `vbox-18`); the reference file does not carry them, so they are taken from the TR as images.
- **Template:** a copy of the AWS deck (course rule R2), so it carries the cloud player (no builds, smooth
  transitions, hidden step/slide switch, presenter and student views) and the slide comments exactly as the
  AWS deck has them (`src/deck/comments.ts`, `CommentsPanel.tsx`, unchanged).

## Decisions

1. **Every word is the reference's.** Only rule 36 moves a full stop. The reference's notes (TR speaker notes,
   TR Visual Guidance) are the speaker notes and the figure spec.
2. **The visual style is session 2's current one** (session 1's 3D finish, `figures/d3/kit.tsx`): `Card` frame,
   lead and body as one block, the points rail beside a raised stage, glossy library renders (`Icon3D`) and
   session 1's clay objects, labels as HTML, one self-running loop per figure held still on harness URLs.
   The reference's and TR's diagrams are redrawn in that finish, same boxes, same names.
3. **Agenda, Key Takeaways and the recap carry the five titles only** (course rule, lesson 4, the user's
   standing word on sessions 1 and 2). Section breakers carry the title only.
4. **Analogies** keep the reference's grammar (EVERYDAY scene, IN THE CLOUD scene, numbered markers on both,
   three mapping pairs under them), drawn in the 3D finish: `PairAnalogy` in `figures/vh/frames.tsx`.
5. **Walkthroughs** (42-51) keep the reference's pairing (two screenshots a frame, numbered captions, the two
   red highlight boxes on captures 1 and 13), with its Important note callout on 42.
6. **Marks** are the reference's own embedded files, filed in `slide-kit/assets/companies/` and
   `slide-kit/assets/aws/` first (rule 13), imported from `figures/vh/marks/` so the single file inlines them.
7. **Thank you and All the Best are two frames**, as session 2 (62 reference frames, 63 slides).
