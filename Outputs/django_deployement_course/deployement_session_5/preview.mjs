/**
 * PREVIEW HARNESS for the standalone HTML deck.
 *
 * Runs the built single-file deck from file:// with all network traffic
 * blocked, then captures two things:
 *
 *   1. A full sweep of every slide with ?all (every build step revealed), so
 *      the contact sheet shows finished slides rather than empty step-0 frames.
 *   2. Mid-flight frames of a slide-to-slide transition and of a Ctrl+Arrow
 *      build step, which is the only way to show that the motion survived
 *      bundling — a settled screenshot cannot.
 *
 *   node preview.mjs [builtHtml] [outDir] [slideCount]
 *
 * All three arguments default to this deck's own values, read from
 * `deck.config.json`, so the bare command is correct in every session.

  THUMBS, written here rather than by hand.

  `scripts/build-preview-page.mjs` inlines `thumbs/NN.jpg` and
  `thumbs/m-transition-N.jpg` as data URIs. Nothing in the repo produced that
  directory: it had been created once by hand, so the contact sheet could only be
  rebuilt in a project that already had one, and in a fresh project the script
  crashed on `readdirSync` at import time. (It does carry a friendly
  "run preview.mjs first" guard for exactly this, 260 lines further down, which
  the crash never reaches.)

  Since this harness already has the page open at each frame, it writes the JPEG
  alongside the PNG. The PNGs stay: they are the lossless record for reading a
  slide, and the JPEGs exist only to keep the one-file contact sheet shareable.

  SETTLE TIME — the slowest self-playing entrance in the kit, plus headroom.

  `?all` forces every click-gated build step open, but it does NOT fast-forward
  the entrances that play themselves on mount. The binding constraint is
  `AgendaSlide`: its items are cued off the curve being drawn, so the last item
  starts at FIRST_AT + (DRAW - FIRST_AT - 0.15) = 1.75s and finishes its 0.55s
  rise at about 2.38s. `DataTable` is second at roughly 1.5s.

  At the old 1100ms every agenda in every deck was captured two items in, with a
  third ghosting at 30% opacity, over an acre of empty slide. That is not a
  content bug and it is not a layout bug, but it is indistinguishable from one in
  a screenshot, and it shipped in a signed-off preview.

  Raise this if a new slide type animates itself for longer, and say what it is.
