/**
 * THE POINT — the sentence under the heading that says what this slide is for.
 *
 * It used to be the `lead` of `SlideHeader`, rendered inside the header block. It
 * is now the first thing in the CONTENT well, above the bullets and any figure,
 * because it is content: the kicker and title NAME the slide, the lead makes its
 * argument. In the header it read as a subtitle of the heading; the heading block
 * is now the heading alone.
 *
 * The move is presentational only. `lead` is still a prop of the slide, still
 * authored in the deck file the same way, and continuity still compares it.
 *
 * WHY IT IS MARKED, AND WHY SO LIGHTLY.
 * Set as plain prose it was indistinguishable from the first bullet under it, and
 * a sentence that reads like a bullet stops doing the job of introducing them. So
 * it carries a single tone-coloured arrow, pointing into the sentence.
 *
 * The arrow is BARE: no tinted holder, no rounded chip behind it. A holder made
 * the mark a small object of its own that the eye stopped on before the words,
 * which is backwards for a line whose whole job is to hand the room the sentence.
 * A stroke on the flat page marks the line without becoming a thing on it.
 *
 * `Callout` is deliberately NOT reused, and this deliberately does not look like
 * one. A callout is a filled panel with a left border, a 40px solid icon block and
 * a bold label, and it interrupts: it is for the warning, the gotcha, the aside.
 * Several of these slides carry a real one in their body, and a lead dressed the
 * same way would compete with it and flatten the difference between "here is the
 * idea" and "here is the trap". This is the lighter register: one glyph, no
 * ground, no label line, and the deck's body-lg type so the sentence still reads
 * as the largest text in the well.
 *
 * WIDTH IS A HARD CONSTRAINT, NOT TASTE.
 * `max-w-3xl` (768px) keeps the text clear of the instructor video, which is
 * composited into `x 913..1280, y 0..220` later and is never drawn on the slide.
 * The header's floor now stops at y=168, so this is the first thing that could
 * reach that band, and an uncapped line at full slide width would run straight
 * through it. `node video-safe.mjs` fails the deck if it does.

    THE GAP BELOW THE POINT IS THIS COMPONENT'S, NOT THE LAYOUT'S.

    It was a `mb-6` written at all seven call sites, which is both a thing to
    forget on the eighth and a number with a geometric consequence no call site
    can see. The header floor is 120px, so the well opens at y=168; one line of
    body-lg is 33px; this gap decides where the first row of real content lands.

    At 24px it landed at 225, nine pixels below the y=216 the old 168px header
    produced, and `align-check.mjs` caught two dense slides whose last line had
    been pushed under the control bar. 16px lands it at 217. Change this and
