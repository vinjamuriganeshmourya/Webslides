  ONE SOURCE, MANY COPIES.

  On the barrel, unlike the four promoted figure FAMILIES under `src/ui/points`,
  `pseudocode`, `projectcode` and `features`, which stay import-by-path. The
  difference is that a family offers a CHOICE between designs for one contract, and
  choosing should be a deliberate act at the import line; `FanOut` is a single
  figure with one shape, like `LayerStack` and `ContainerJourney` beside it.

  Promoted out of `deployement_session_1_v2`, where it was a deck-local
  `ImageFanout` hardcoded to one image and three containers. The contract carries
  no Docker in it: the same figure draws one build and many environments, or one

  THREE LANES — how far the automation reaches under each of the three CI/CD
  terms. On the barrel as one figure with one shape, like `FanOut` above it.

  Chosen out of `slide-kit/cicd-reach-lab`, which built four candidates for the
  same contract: `StopPoints` (three markers on one chain), `NestedSpans` (three
  brackets above it), `ReachBands` (three bars from a shared left edge) and this.
  The lab's brief came from the session 7 review, "research the best ways to
  represent CI/CD and use those", and the answer that survived is the
  conventional one: Atlassian, Red Hat, AWS Prescriptive Guidance, CircleCI, IBM
  and Bitrise all publish the same picture, so a learner who reads any article
  after the session meets this diagram again.

  It is also the only candidate that asks NOTHING of the viewer. The other three
  draw the reach as an abstraction over a single chain, so a reader has to carry
  a bar or bracket's right end back up to the stage above it. Here each lane
  states its own outcome in place. The price is height, paid three times, and it
  fits: measured at 394px against the 425px ceiling where a composite's top edge
  starts centring into the instructor-video reserve.

  `ReachBands` stays in the lab rather than the kit. It is the same convention
  drawn in 276px, and worth promoting if a future deck needs the height back.

  TILL ROW. One waiting line, and a fixed number of service desks that the
  front of the line can go to either of. On the barrel as one figure with one
  shape, like `ThreeLanes` above it.

  Chosen out of `slide-kit/queue-lab`, which built three candidates for the same
  `QueueFigureProps` contract: `QueueBelt`, `DashboardPanels` and this. The claim
  all three had to carry is that one job is triggered, runs wait in a line, and a
  fixed number of executor slots take them.

  It won because it is the only candidate that DRAWS THE MECHANISM rather than
  the parts. A connector leaves the front of the line, runs along a rail under
  both desks, and rises into each desk's bottom edge with its own arrowhead, so
  the dependency between a free slot and the next ticket is geometry rather than
  words. That dependency is the one thing a learner cannot work out from a list
  of four definitions, and the other two candidates either state it in a caption
  or leave it to be inferred.

  It also keeps Jenkins' own panel titles, `Build queue` and `Build executor
  status` with its slot count, so it still passes content rule 27: a picture the
  learner meets again elsewhere beats a better one they see once.

  `QueueBelt` lost because its tickets run RIGHT TO LEFT inside the queue well,
  so a reader scanning left to right meets `#4` before `#3` and has to be told by
  a caption which end is the front. `DashboardPanels` lost because it draws the
  two panels and not the flow between them, which leaves the reader to infer the
  one relationship the figure exists to show. Both stay in the lab, and
  `DashboardPanels` is worth reaching for if a future slide needs the panels
  without the flow.
