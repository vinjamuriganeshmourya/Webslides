 * Session-local override of slide-template/src/ui/panels/beats.tsx

 *
 * WHY. Review, 2026-10-01: "when all steps are complete, the button beside
 * Replay still looks active". The kit's disabled Next is the same brand blue
 * at 40% opacity, which from the back of a room reads as a paler live button.
 * Here a disabled step button turns grey (surface, muted text, no shadow).
 * Replay's slot now holds the Autoplay switch (2026-10-07, see StepControls).
 *
 * Every button answers the press (`Press`), as the rest of the deck's
 * controls do.
