/**
 * ONE TIMING SCALE FOR EVERY VARIANT.
 *
 * WHY THESE NUMBERS ARE NOT THE `animate` SKILL'S NUMBERS
 *
 * That skill's duration table caps UI at 300ms and calls a 400ms dropdown
 * sluggish. It is right, and it is about a different thing: a dropdown is opened
 * by the person watching it, tens of times a day, and the animation sits between
 * them and what they came for.
 *
 * A slide figure is the same skill's EXPLANATORY tier, where it says plainly that
 * durations can be longer. Nobody triggers it, nobody repeats it, and it is read
 * once, from the back of a room, on a projector, while an instructor is talking
 * over it. The first pass of these four variants used 240 to 280ms entrances and
 * a 70ms stagger, and on screen it reads as a flinch: the figure has finished
 * assembling before the room has finished looking up from their laptops.
 *
 * So the tier is explanatory and the numbers below are roughly double. They are
 * still bounded: nothing here is a 2-second reveal, because the instructor has
 * to be able to talk over the whole figure landing without waiting for it.
 *
 * These are the ONLY durations a variant may use. Four figures that differ in
 * geometry should not also differ in tempo, or comparing them compares the wrong
 * thing.
