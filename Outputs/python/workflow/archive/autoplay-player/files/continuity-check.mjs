/**
 * CONTINUITY CHECK — proves that an unchanged header part does not re-animate.
 *
 *   node continuity-check.mjs 6 7 14        # check the move INTO each of these slides
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AS A HARNESS
 *
 * Continuity (see `src/motion/continuity.ts`) is invisible in a settled
 * screenshot: whether the kicker flew in or sat still, one second later the slide
 * looks identical. The first implementation was silently a no-op for exactly that
 * reason — `Stepper` reported its step count on mount, that re-render collapsed
 * the continuity value, React remounted the header parts and they animated in
 * anyway about 100ms late. Nothing in `qa.mjs`, `video-safe.mjs` or the preview
 * sweep could have caught it.
 *
 * So this samples mid-flight. For each slide N given, it settles on N-1, presses
 * ArrowRight, and reads the computed opacity and transform of the kicker, the
 * title and the first bullet 110ms in.
 *
 * HOW TO READ THE OUTPUT
 *
 *   HELD      op=1.00, tf=none          the part never moved
 *   ANIMATING op<1 and/or a transform   the part is entering
 *
 * Expected: inside one concept the kicker is HELD and the title and body are
 * ANIMATING. Crossing into a new concept, or arriving from a divider, everything
 * is ANIMATING. A kicker that is ANIMATING while the previous slide showed the
 * same kicker text is the regression this file is here to find.
