/**
 * QUESTION + POINTS — the pause beat, and then the answer on the same frame.
 *
 * HOW THIS DOES NOT BREAK HARD RULE 16
 *
 * Rule 16 says a question slide carries the question and nothing else. It exists
 * so that while the room is thinking, there is nothing on screen to read instead
 * of thinking — a question with its answer printed underneath is not a question,
 * it is a heading.
 *
 * This type keeps that true by making the points BUILD STEPS. At step 0 the
 * slide is the question, the qualifier and nothing else: identical in substance
 * to `QuestionSlide`. The room answers out loud, and only then does the first
 * click bring the first point in. The rule constrains what is on screen while
 * the question is open, and an unrevealed step is not on screen.
 *
 * WHEN TO USE THIS INSTEAD OF `QuestionSlide`
 *
 * Use `QuestionSlide` when the ANSWER IS THE NEXT SLIDE — when the response
 * needs a figure, a terminal, or room to breathe. That is the default and it
 * stays the default.
 *
 * Use this one when the answer is two or three short points and putting them on
 * their own slide would mean the room reads the answer having lost sight of the
 * question. Keeping both on one frame is the argument for this type; if the
 * points do not need the question visible above them, they did not need to be
 * here.
 *
 * WHAT IT STILL MUST NOT CARRY: a figure, a code panel, a callout. Those make it
 * a `ContentSlide` whose lead ends in a question mark, which is a different
 * slide with a different job.
 *
 * LAYOUT
 *
 * No `SlideHeader`. Like `QuestionSlide`, the question IS the slide, so it is
 * set at title scale rather than at lead scale under a larger heading.
 *
 * The card is capped at 840px and left-aligned, so its right edge lands at x=904
 * and clears the instructor-video rectangle (x 913..1280, y 0..220) at any
 * height. `QuestionSlide` arrived at the same number the same way. The card is
 * shorter here than there (`min-h-[220px]` against 440) because the points below
 * it need the rest of the well; there is no oversized `?` glyph for the same
 * reason.
